  description = """\
The first few days of my stay are spent in Friedrichshain along the Spree. Jetlagged beyond belief, I take a walk at 5 AM and realize that I'm staying next to the longest continuous section of the [Berlin Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall) that's still standing, known as the "East Side Gallery".

The wall, or officially the **Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart** by East Germany's GDR, wasn't built to repel invasion as the name suggests, but as an emergency effort to keep their own population in. Flight to the west was so bad that it was compromising the viability of the country's economy, with departees disproportionately of working age and professionally skilled.

Khrushchev and Ulbricht conspired to close the border in August 1961 despite the inevitable damage it would do to communism's PR. The wall started life as barbed wire entanglements on August 13th ("Barbed Wire Sunday") and a few refinements later would became the _Grenzmauer 75_ (Border Wall 1975) of 45,000 prefab concrete blocks that we recognize today.

**At the begining of 1989, GDR leader Erich Honecker predicted that the wall would stand stand strong for 50 or 100 more years**, but that same year, a refugee crisis pressured the East German government to revise crossing regulations with a provision for private round trips. Miscommunication in the party's hierarchy caused a spokesman to suggest that the new rules would come into effect immediately, when they were supposed to activate the following day to provide time for border guards to be briefed. Televised broadcasts prompted huge gatherings at the wall's six checkpoints demanding to cross. As pressure continued to build, the vastly outnumbered soldiers would eventually allow it as no one was willing to authorize the use of lethal force.

Since then, sections of the wall have been exported around the world and can be found [everywhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Berlin_Wall_segments#Indonesia) from Manitoba to Indonesia to Estonia. Graffiti had been a common fixture on the west side of the wall for some time, but graffiti on its _east_ side, like that pictured below is new, appearing only after the '89 collapse.

Back home packing, I waffle over whether I can get away without bringing a jacket. Finally, I decide to try it. I know it's risky, but keep it light.

Fast forward 24 hours: I land in a Berlin that's not only hot, but _so_ hot that the city is skimming temperature records, with daily highs like 34 degrees (93F). Thoughts of jackets are quickly forgotten; replaced with brainstorming on how to strip off as many layers as possible while avoiding arrest for public indecency.

Berlin has some amazing running routes, but this year even a few kilometers are oppressive. A painful workaround is to go early -- like _really_ early -- ideally 5:30 or so, when the mercury's "only" in the high teens/low twenties. Long daylight hours (the sun rises before 5 AM) combined with jet lag make the ambitious schedule possible.

This photo's of the wilderness along my favorite run -- follow the Spree southeast out of Friedrichshain, into northern Kreuzberg (say "hi" to the people still partying), passed the sunken [MS Dr. Ingrid Wengler](https://fotostrasse.com/abandoned-boat-spree-river/) and [Molecule Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule_Man_(sculpture\\)), through Treptower Park, and then south by and around the ruins of [Spreepark](https://www.abandonedberlin.com/2010/04/spreepark-and-how-to-get-in.html) (scroll down at that link for some great photos, and hundreds of anecdata points from people sneaking passed the fence).

The work took years and involved some 30,000 students -- among them a young physics student named Angela Merkel.

Today, it's a night club and cultural space inside a fortress, and runs from dusk until dawn every night of WGT.

One of the best parts of cities with long histories is the repurposing of derelict properties for more creative uses.

One of the city's curious penchants is to convert old public pools into live music venues. Last year I ran into this in [Stadtbad](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadtbad_(Leipzig\\)), Leipzig's old three wing central bath complex.

It's highly reminiscent of New York's [High Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Line), except with a more raw nature, fewer Blue Bottles, and *far* fewer people (finding green space in Berlin isn't quite the same level of competition as it is in New York). Similarly to the High Line, it's elevated three meters above the surrounding streets, and that vertical separation creates an effect of peaceful isolation from surrounding traffic.

I came across Nordbahnhof purely by accident as I was touring the area northwest of mitte, and was glad I did. Along the way: an overgrown rail bridge, old paving stones stacked into megalithic cubes, and the most dangerous-looking amusement park I've ever seen, complete with gutted cars suspended 80 feet in the air.

Technically, these days I work for a company headquartered in South Carolina. Charleston specifically.

A team on-site last August was the first time I'd ever visited the city. After getting off a rare direct flight from SFO, we ventured inwards, and were delighted by the charm of its old French Quarter, finding this bar semi-randomly as we shopped for venues along the street.

Along with the picteresque old buildings, we got to experience another aspect of coastal life the same night as the sky opened and rain came down in sheets. Driving into downtown, the streets had been bone dry. Driving back out only a few hours later, our Uber forded against a torrential flood flowing down the streets.

  description = """\
The first ever Stripe [Sessions](https://stripe.com/sessions) in 2017, which I don't think I think I was supposed to be attending, but for which I was given a spot at the last second.

As I was looking at these, I was wishing that I'd written more down about the period since I didn't remember much anymore, only to realize that I'd been good about writing journal entries around then, and had a long one from that day. Most of it's unpublishable, but here's an excerpt about employee orientation:

> They gave us the usual spiel about how we should never get more specific than saying that we process "billions of dollars for hundreds of thousands of businesses", and said that we shouldn't say anything about the technology being Sigma (to add mystique and imply that it's built on a powerful platform proprietary to Stripe).

It was the launch day for [Stripe's Sigma](https://stripe.com/sigma), which would be announced as part of a Jobs-esque event keynote.

Stripe's [_Increment_ magazine](https://increment.com/on-call/) had just launched a few months earlier, and you can see a few of the issues of _On-call (#1)_ laid out. I'd thought _Increment_ was a mangificient idea, but my instinct nowadays is more akin to finding a shredder as I realize that the issue was written _about_ on-call in an organizational sense, but with very little input from the people who _actually were on-call_. This was reflective of Stripe's top-down attitude towards engineering resources, which were interchangeable cogs whose worth went as far as the specific functions they performed. An engineer's on-call wasn't a service to be respected -- it was a duty, and a duty with a 5-minute SLA.

These photos are five years olds, but I've had Stripe on the mind because [they've been in the news recently](https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/ceo-patrick-collisons-email-to-stripe-employees).
