I visited the British Museum in London during my stay there last year. The museum has a wealth of ancient artifacts, including some of the most famous ones in history like the Rosetta Stone, but despite having my camera with me, I took few photos while I was there. All I could think of was the tens of thousands of times each of these objects was photographed every day, contributing to an enormous body of billions of photos, 99.9999% would never be glanced again.

This is one of the few artifacts I photographed because I liked it so much. It's artwork on stone depicting Assyrian royals taking part in a lion hunt, circa 645 BC, right around the period where the civilization would collapse.

At the time I knew almost nothing about Assyria, but a friend sent over the excellent episode ["Empire of Iron"](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/13-the-assyrians-empire-of-iron/id1449884495?i=1000525464222) from Paul Cooper's _Fall of Civilizations_ podcast (also you [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpAphcaVJIs)). It starts describing how the Greek general Xenophon came across the ruins of two colossal cities as he was returning from a battle in 401 BC. We know now that these were the Assyrian cities Kalhu and Nineveh, but by then (about 200 years post-collapse) locals knew nothing about them, despite their far greater scope and sophistication than anything they could build at the time. It would've been like living amongst ancient ruins built by giants.

Sadly, my time in Berlin has come to an end.

My way out is through the Berlin Brandenburg airport (BER), my first flying out of it. I visited Berlin last year, but took the train in and out both directions.

Germany's traditional reptuation from my youth was as a country known for its precise, efficient engineering, a reputation that's been slowly backsliding over the intervening decades, with this airport perhaps the
 most conspicuous symbol of that process.

Construction started in 2006, with an opening target of 2011. I remember visiting Berlin for the first time in December 2011 and being told that the next time I came through, I'd be landing at the city's magnificent new airport. But over the next decade, the oft seen mix of incompetence, graft, and regulation delayed opening a half dozen times until October 2020, a decade behind schedule, and ballooning its original €2.83B budget to €10.3B, with another billion EUR or so of loans still planned.

The good news is that Berlin finally has a decent airport, with	Schönefeld and Tegel previously leaving a lot to be desired (although I did speak to someone last week who passionately argued that Tegel was one of the best airports in use, a point on which I vehemently disagreed, but was substantiated with reasonable arguments). It's spacious, with reasonably efficient check-in counters and security checks (my sample size of is one, so take that with a grain of sault). It's connected to not only the S-bahn, but the Deutsche Bahn network, with a direct regional train between it and Ostkreuz that's only a 20 minute ride (in fact, DB sued the airport as the station it built in 2011 sat unused for years).

I appreciated that the airport's builders borrowed themes from Berlin architecture elsewhere, with a huge open plaza ("airport city"), and giant megalithic pillars holding up the structure overhead. So big and so high that they're ominous to look at.

We'd gone to a show at Täubchenthal, where my camera had been confiscated. Rules around what cameras are and aren't allowed in WGT venues are so nebulous that no one, including the staff themselves, understand exactly what they're supposed to be. I was carrying my R6 with a small 28 mm lens which I thought could fly in under the radar, but one of the doormen objected to it being "professional equipment" (also poorly defined), and demanded that I present a press pass. I thought about explaining that with a 28 mm the best I could hope for shooting a band would be a wide angle of the audience with the performers occupying a few degrees of space in the middle of the shot, but decided not to dig myself in any deeper, and we came to a detente after I agreed to coat check it.

Let's assume a crowd of ~1,000 people, each with a smartphone, and 75% of whom are compelled to use it once a minute or so. Given a 60 minute show, that gives us 1,000 ⋅ 0.75 ⋅ 60 = 45,000 crappy photos per band per night that no one, including the shooter themselves, will ever look at again. And this is for gothic rock events with modest crowds. Taylor Swift surely generates two or three orders of magnitude more than that, and the photos are even worse, having been taken thousands of feet away.

So that's a long way of saying that my logic around concert photos is roughly this: I don't need to be adding to that corpus. I'll leave it to the aspiring TikTok stars to post blurry, AI-corrected show photos. The sun is setting late in Germany right now, and I took the camera along hoping to do some walking in Leipzig after the show, hopefully during golden hour. Afterwards, I travelled up Zschochersche Street towards Felsenkeller, and then back east downtown. An immensely pleasant little area, and I got a couple shots I liked, but I'd come out just a little too late, and the light had already turned.

I'm simultaneously a Euro critic and Euro fanatic. Having spent a few weeks here now, and being stopped on _every_ website I visit with a complicated cookie modal, I'm reminded with great frequency that Europe's main tech export by a wide margin is regulation. Admittedly, occasionally this has positive results for all of us (e.g. [the iPhone 15 on USB-C](/nanoglyphs/041-15-16#usb-c)), but the continent sure isn't making itself _more_ relevant, and there's a strong argument to be made that it's going to have serious ramifications for long term prosperity.

But my god, if the lows are low, then the highs are stratospheric. The architecture, the food, the walkability -- after visiting and enjoying it all, I have periods of malaise pondering that the US and Canada will never have any of these things.

If there's one thing I wish every North American could see in Germany, it'd be [the third spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Space_Theory). This is Leipzig on a spring/summer Saturday night, and I can't even begin to capture the sense of community in photos. The city's entire main square has been pedestrianized, with tables laid out with space for thousands. It's late by North American standards--passed 10 PM--but the night shows no signs of slowing down, and with all age groups represented including kids and elders. There's no way you could tell from looking around, but there's a high speed, high capacity train directly under us that'd put America's most advanced rail to shame. No one has to worry about parking or driving home drunk.

How many non-Germans could tell you a city named "Leipzig" even exists, let alone point to it on a map? Everyone on Earth's heard of San Francisco, but the difference in vitality between these two place is night and day. Like, I'm not saying the disparity is 10%, 50%, or 2x. Not even 10x. No, let's call it more like 100x. 10 PM on a Saturday night San Francisco has _a pulse_ because it's Saturday night (although only in select places like Valencia, the Castro, or North Beach), but only a pulse. Even those who took the bold step of leaving their homes will be back there in another hour or two, safely watching Netflix and ordering DoorDash from behind barred windows with the other 95% who never deigned to step foot beyond their front door in the first place.

And it matters. Not only does lack of commerce leave neighborhoods empty, homogenous wastelands, but never seeing the faces of your fellow countrymen is almost certainly one of the major factors in the continued atomization and political strife that the US is seeing in spades. I'll leave a more serious commentary to another time, but come on, fewer fentanyl exclusion zones and Zoom events, and more of this please.

Block after block the ground floor is filled with an ample supply of restaurants and bars, most of which have outdoor seating that spreads out onto the sidewalk. And block after block, these places are _busy_. It doesn't matter if it's Saturday evening or Wednesday night, 7 PM or 10 PM, practically the whole city is out of their homes carousing.

Follow a tunnel to the next courtyard, and there's another one. And another beyond that. And another beyond that.

All I can think of is that if you consider the shape of the courtyards, they're squares on the horizontal axes, but with tall vertical walls on every side.

I remembered that this was May 1st, or May Day, and was instructed by Google Maps that this square was the _Place de la Nation_, which I'd later find out had a storied history for having the most active guillotines during the French Revolution.

Others are easier. This photo is from a run in Bath (in the UK) where one could run south from the city center to the river Avon, and from there long distances in either direction on paths that followed its winding flow.

When you go early, once in a while you run into something cool. Here, I randomly came across two Virgin hot air balloons being inflated in a wide field along the river, witnessed by only myself, another couple who was also out trail running, and a few early morning kayakers.

  description = """
The Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta. Definitely a cool place. Although located in a landlocked city, for almost a decade it was the largest aquarium in the world, not surpassed until 2012 by the S.E.A. Aquarium in Singapore and Chimelong Ocean Kingdom in the PRC. Its signature exhibit is a gigantic 6.3 million US gallon tank with viewing wall and submarine tunnel, filled with manta rays, enormous groupers. appropriately named [bowmouth guitarfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhina_ancylostoma), and of course, whale shark(s) (along with many other species, but as in open-water diving, it's usually the big stuff that gets the attention).

You may be wondering why I write whale sharks(s). I was curious how and when the aquarium was sourcing whale sharks, and started looking into it. All six sharks have come from Taiwan, where it'd been legal to capture them for consumption up until the practice was banned in 2007.

The first set of four named Ralph, Norton, Alice, and Trixie arrived in 2006. Unfortunately Ralph and North didn't take well to the new environment and passed away in 2007, but the same year the aquarium sourced two more named Taroko and Yushan just before Taiwan's ban came into effect. Trixie had quite a long life in Atlanta, but passed away recently in 2020, and Alice in 2021.

Six minus four would suggest two remaining whale sharks, but I spent a good half hour at the tank and for the life on me could only count one. I observed a feeding session in which a caretaker started dropping chow from an overhead boat which attracted one whale shark multiple times, but not two. It's very possible that I'm just bad at counting, but the aquarium itself seems to be quite cagey in talking about anything too specific on whale sharks besides that a species by that name _definitely_ exists. I trawled their site with a number of targeted search terms and got nothing. Everything I sourced above was from third parties.

Ethics of keeping whale sharks in captivity aside, if you have the opportunity and are interested, it might not be the worst time to drop by Georgia Aquarium to see this magnificent beast(s). Absent a new way to source them -- probably not particularly forthcoming in 2023 -- this might not be the kind of exhibit that lasts forever.

For the 10%, I'm sorry. Despite all the talk from CEOs of "hard economic conditions" *bullsh\\*t* *bullsh\\*t*, the reality is that you were caught in an opportunistic dragnet of the executive arm to trim the (perceived) cruft. When everybody else is doing it too, negative press is diffused.

Another signature San Francisco office gone. I'd been there a number of times over the years, and it was a contender for top two best offices in the city, which implied top two in the world. They had a secret speakeasy, a replica of the oval office, and every kid's dream -- a _frikkin' secret passage in a bookshelf_. The Octocat seal on the floor of their oval office [originally read](https://www.businessinsider.com/githubs-oval-office-2013-9) "United Meritocracy of GitHub" before "meritocracy" was deemed an illegal word and the seal replaced.

I looked back through my photos of the place, and to my great regret, seem to have taken only two. One was of the bar (of course). The other is above, wherein GitHub hosted a roguelike conference back in 2017 (I wonder if that wifi password still works?). They were great about community events, also having let us host an API hackathon in 2016.

Rewinding even further, way back in 2012 I had the honor of visiting GitHub's _original_ office in SOMA. Nowhere near as elaborate, but spacious, and with the look of a cool, unfinished loft. All of us loved technology so we had beers and talked about technology. I have a distinct memory of being introduced to ChatOps for the very first time.

And the era continues to shift.

Unknownst to most, Twitter isn't only the latest front of the culture war, but also one of its first. A big reason that Twitter HQ is located in the midst of San Francisco's mid-Market blight in the first place is that the city's last mayor incentivized the move back in 2011 by erasing the 1.5% payroll tax the company would normally pay in hopes that its presence could help revitalize the neighborhood. San Francisco's resident regressive population screamed at the perceived giveaway to big tech, and would spend the next ten years fighting an ever escalating war to keep the city frozen in time, a war that they eventually won as tech fled in 2020.

I take these photos to capture a moment in time -- my guess is that this sign isn't around for much longer. The latest news is that Twitter's office space has been downsized from six floors to two, and given Musk's history of [moving companies to more friendly and lower tax states like Texas](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-texas-headquarters-move-from-california-officiallly-complete-elon-musk-2021-12), I'd be surprised if this isn't San Francisco's newest empty building sometime soon.

Yesterday I posted about [510 Townsend St office](/sequences/036), the third Stripe office I worked at after Pioneer and Ivy.

Here's one that I never made it to -- HQ 4.0 or 5.0 (depending on how you count) at Oyster Point in South San Francisco. These are the central stairs that run up the middle of the building, an idea that came out of Pioneer and faithfully recreated at Townsend and on the new campus. Stripe's idea is they were a central point to be cross-pollinated by people from all parts of the company, and would allow random, serendipitous meetings between people who normally wouldn't see each other as part of their normal work.

Stripe made the right decision to move out of San Francisco, but while the new office is absolutely gorgeous, it's impossible to miss how sterile Oyster Point feels outside the buildings. Beautifully architected concrete and glass, surrounded by wide roads, promenades to nowhere that nobody uses, and active construction on multiple sides. No grass or parks in any direction. I wonder whether if the new HQ hadn't been locked in just a little later (closer to 2020), if the whole project wouldn't have been cancelled in favor of remote and offices in more vital cities, like what happened with Pinterest's planned SF building which they paid a whopping $89.5M to back out of.

Perfectly stackable rectangles, a full fifty of them fit on one floor of the modestly sized building.

But it's got some nice touches. Self check-in works well, and a full bank of half a dozen terminals means no lines. A generous common room with beautiful decor encourages guests to get out of their rooms and mingle downstairs. Badging into a room brings on all lights inside automatically, so no fumbling for switches. And while each light gets a switch for individual control, two master switches -- one by the bed and one by the exit -- light or extinguish them all simultaneously. Not exactly trascendant product craftsmanship, but having applied a modicum of thought to layout and design puts citizenM in the top bracket amongst its peers.

Staying in cities is expensive and getting moreso. Predictably, AirBnB has equalized in cost with hotels, and hotel prices are going up, showing ~8.5% inflation YoY.

Later, continuing [Spring '83 implementation](https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/specifying-spring-83/), I wrote [neospring-bridge](https://github.com/brandur/neospring-bridge), which cross-posts this feed to [neospring](https://github.com/brandur/neospring) as a board (try `curl https://neospring.brandur.org/2c98169d0b6fa73cab5a830be8dde53c5f388d5c6f8e6f756b6b6dbcc83e1124`). I still need to do something with layout, federation, and a frontend, and it's far and away the most likely outcome that this project doesn't get traction, but it's been a great hack project.

Not Waterloo, Washington. Today, investigating Seattle neighborhoods, I did a grand loop of inner Seattle -- starting on the University of Washington campus, up through the University District, west to Green Lake and onto Phinney Ridge, then down through Fremont and back along the west shore of Lake Union until I was back in Amazon central (South Lake Union).

Seattle's a nice city, but wow, also a busy one. From Belltown to Ballard, every road is loud and fast, and apparently a thoroughfare to somewhere else. Walking around West Lake, I'm not sure I've seen a busier park in my life. Looking at a map it makes sense -- hundreds of thousands of adjacent residents with only a handful of local park options to choose from, and falling back on what they can.

There's got to be a slower-paced neighborhood around here, but one that's not too far out in the 'burbs right? I have another half dozen yet unexplored recommendations. We'll see what the next few days yield.

This morning, got [most of a Spring '83 server](https://github.com/brandur/neospring) implementation done. It deploys automatically to GCP, but it took a couple hours of futzing around to get there. GCP's inscrutable, debug-by-trial-and-error ACL model is one of the most nightmarish things I've seen in 20+ years of programming. I'd originally intended to have it persist to Postgres, but after thinking about it over breakfast, realized this was a perfect use case for writing tiny 2217-byte blobs to an object store. It's running, but I'm still not publishing anything to it -- more to come.

You'll have to give me a break on photo quality for this one -- it's hard getting something good through the foggy glass of a plane window.

This is [Mount Rainier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rainier), the tallest mountain in Washington state and the Cascade mountain range, and also one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world. It's on the list of [Decade Volcanoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade_Volcanoes) thanks to its history of large, destructive eruptions and near proximity to a dense populzation zone. Wikipedia almost notes that it's the most topologically prominent peak in the contiguous US, dwarfing everything else around it and having quite a striking effect on the eye.

I just landed in Seattle. It's colder than expected. Like colder than it rightfully should be in any west coast city. Luckily, I learned from [my mistake in New York](/nanoglyphs/033-heroku#new-york) and came equipped with a variety of cold weather gear this time around. I haven't had a chance to do much yet besides check into my hotel and head over to the flagship Amazon Go store, which was quite busy, but appeared to be about 5% shoppers, and 95% senior Amazon staff chatting in small circles, lauding each other on their own ingenuity. Still, it was nice seeing a downtown that'd regained some of its lost vibrancy.

I got a coffee, along with a note saying that Amazon is "working on my receipt", but nothing since. I suspect it might be a Mechanical Turk who ends up piecing together my bill from video rather than the finely tuned neural nets of a hyper-sophisticated ML cluster, but I might be a cynic. On my way out, someone handed me a free banana from a cart parked next to a geodesic dome.

Last weekend I wrote a [Spring '83 key generator](https://github.com/brandur/spring83-keygen), and on the flight got maybe halfway to a working server implementation. Tomorrow, more Seattle, more Spring '83, and work time spent on SSO and polish on a forthcoming metrics product for Bridge.

I made my way downtown, and getting off at Montgomery, randomly ran into Mark, an old API buddy. We talked API DSLs, OpenAPI, and tooling for generating workflows and libraries for a good half hour -- maybe my first IRL API discussion in years.

I stopped by Salesforce Park afterwards to shoot some rare photos of its grounds empty and in the rain. but made the error of bringing only a prime 50 mm, which turned out to exactly the wrong lens for the job. I didn't do it justice in the above, but it's a remarkably great park.

Charleston again, continuing from [024](/sequences/024). A few of us arrived a day before our on-site officially started, and intended to spend the day sightseeing in downtown.

We did, sort of. We took the water taxi in, walked around for half an hour, but just like the night before, the sky opened up. Taking refuge in a nearby coffee shop, we hoped to wait the problem out, but in Charleston, the weather can stay irritating longer than you can stay patient. We timed out after about an hour and went to lunch instead, and even by the time we finished that, the rain wasn't done. I called the water tax to see if we could still take it for the return trip and their response was, "technically yes, but you might not want to" (it's a small, flat, very exposed type of boat). We took an Uber instead.

A side effect of the plethora of rain is that it left me with few photos of Charleston overall -- our on-site started the next day and we spent most of it in meeting rooms. I'm looking forward to making my way back to Charleston somewhere down the line to correct that.

The first ever Stripe [Sessions](https://stripe.com/sessions) in 2017, which I don't think I think I was supposed to be attending, but for which I was given a spot at the last second.

As I was looking at these, I was wishing that I'd written more down about the period since I didn't remember much anymore, only to realize that I'd been good about writing journal entries around then, and had a long one from that day. Most of it's unpublishable, but here's an excerpt about employee orientation:

> They gave us the usual spiel about how we should never get more specific than saying that we process "billions of dollars for hundreds of thousands of businesses", and said that we shouldn't say anything about the technology behind Sigma (to add mystique and imply that it's built on a powerful, secret platform proprietary to Stripe).

It was the launch day for [Stripe's Sigma](https://stripe.com/sigma), which would be announced as part of a Jobs-esque event keynote.

Stripe's [_Increment_ magazine](https://increment.com/on-call/) had just launched a few months earlier, and you can see a few of the issues of _On-call (#1)_ laid out. I'd thought _Increment_ was a mangificient idea, but my instinct nowadays is more akin to finding the nearest shredder. The whole issue was written _about_ on-call in an organizational sense, but with very little input from the people who _actually were on-call_. This was reflective of Stripe's top-down attitude towards engineering resources, which were interchangeable cogs whose worth went as far as the specific functions they performed. An engineer's on-call wasn't a service to be respected by the org -- it was a mandated duty, and one with a 5-minute SLA.

These photos are five years olds, but I've had Stripe on the mind because [they've been in the news recently](https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/ceo-patrick-collisons-email-to-stripe-employees).

This photo was taken just a few minutes after opening during one if its quieter moments, but it's easy to see that Silo is a neighborhood favorite. Half an hour later all its blocky little benches inside and out would be full -- and this was a weekday.

I spent my first few nights in Friedrichshain, and there Silo was an obvious breakfast choice, but regardless of where I was staying later in the trip, I often found myself commuting back to visit once again. Just one more flat white before I go.

Some portraits of monkeys in the hot spring outside the rooftop Monkey Bar in the 25hours Hotel in Berlin. Yes it’s crappy Photoshop, yes those precariously positioned drinks are in serious danger of being knocked over, yes those monkeys are probably too young to drink. I don't care. Great concept. Great bar. I want to believe.

I previously published a section in [_Passages & Glass_](/newsletter) about going to see [Japanese macaques near Nagano](/passages/002-japan#macaques). It was amazing, even if as bad luck would have it, they weren't enjoying drinks at the time.

  description = """\
Park auf dem Nordbahnhof ("Park on the Nordbahnhof") -- one of the more beautiful legacies of the wall. The area was originally part of a train line that led to the since demolished Nordbahnhof station. By 1961, the line was completely shut down as it became part of border fortifications for the new wall nearby. After the wall's collapse, it became a park.

It's highly reminiscent of New York's [High Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Line), except with a more raw nature, fewer Blue Bottles, and *far* fewer people (finding green space in Berlin isn't quite the same level of competition as it is in New York). Similarly to the High Line, it's elevated three meters above the surrounding streets, and that vertical separation creates an effect of peaceful isolation from surrounding traffic.

I came across Nordbahnhof purely by accident as I was touring the area northwest of mitte, and was glad I did. Along the way: an overgrown rail bridge, old paving stones stacked into megalithic cubes, and the most dangerous-looking amusement park I've ever seen, complete with gutted cars suspended 80 feet in the air.

One of the best parts of cities with long histories is the repurposing of derelict properties for more creative uses. Berlin, with artist squats in old department stores and night clubs in power plants, is the ultimate example of this sort of organic urban evolution in action. Leipzig isn't far behind.

One of the city's curious penchants is to convert old public pools into live music venues. Last year I ran into this in [Stadtbad](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadtbad_(Leipzig\\)), Leipzig's old three wing central bath complex. This year: **Westbad**, the roof of which is pictured below -- a mix of amazing bath art, and modern metal frameworks to suspend speaker stacks.

Sometimes a series of historical accidents leads to something amazing that never could've been planned from the top down. Moritzbastei is one of those.

Originally the ancient city fortifications for Leipzig, it lost its military function during the [Seven Years' War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War) and was relegated to storage. In 1974, the students club of the nearby University of Leipzig uncovered it and began a reabilitation project. The work took years and involved some 30,000 students -- among them a young physics student named Angela Merkel.

Today, it's a night club and cultural space inside a fortress, and runs from dusk until dawn every night of WGT. Photos often use optical tricks to make small places look larger, but this one does the opposite -- it's only a narrow glimpse into a huge space that spans a dozen rooms in a labyrinthine complex spanning many floors.

Berlin has some nice parks and trails, but they pale compared to Leipzig's, which for money must be the running capital of Germany.

Head south out of the city center, through lively city parks containing beer gardens and stark Cold War era playgrounds. Help disoriented morning revelers still out from last night with directions back to their hotel. Follow the river. Notice how well-used paths turn to trails through tranquil forest smelling heavily of garlic ([collecting wild garlic](https://english.leipzig.de/services-and-administration/public-order-and-security/gathering-wild-garlic-in-leipzig/) is a signature activity of springtime Leipzig). Keep an eye out for overgrown cobblestone roads, abandoned tram lines, snails in the long grass, and wild boar (wild only in sense of the [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_boar) -- wisely fenced off).

Photo taken at my southermost reach near Agra -- just a few hundred feet from hundreds of tents housing sleeping festivalgoers at the WGT campground.

This is Darkher performing her particular brand of slow doom metal, and there's no venue more appropriate for it (the original Pantheon wasn't available).

Back home packing, I waffle over whether I can get away without bringing a jacket. Finally, I decide to try it. I know it's risky, but keep it light.

Fast forward 24 hours: I land in a Berlin that's not only hot, but _so_ hot that the city is skimming temperature records, with daily highs like 34 degrees (93F). Thoughts of jackets are quickly forgotten; replaced with brainstorming on how to strip off as many layers as possible while avoiding arrest for public indecency.

Berlin has some amazing running routes, but this year even a few kilometers are oppressive. A painful workaround is to go early -- like _really_ early -- ideally 5:30 or so, when the mercury's "only" in the high teens/low twenties. Long daylight hours (the sun rises before 5 AM) combined with jet lag make the ambitious schedule possible.

This photo's of the wilderness along my favorite run -- follow the Spree southeast out of Friedrichshain, into northern Kreuzberg (say "hi" to the people still partying), passed the sunken [MS Dr. Ingrid Wengler](https://fotostrasse.com/abandoned-boat-spree-river/) and [Molecule Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule_Man_(sculpture\\)), through Treptower Park, and then south by and around the ruins of [Spreepark](https://www.abandonedberlin.com/2010/04/spreepark-and-how-to-get-in.html) (scroll down at that link for some great photos, and hundreds of anecdata points from people sneaking passed the fence).

  description = """\
The first few days of my stay are spent in Friedrichshain along the Spree. Jetlagged beyond belief, I take a walk at 5 AM and realize that I'm staying next to the longest continuous section of the [Berlin Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall) that's still standing, known as the "East Side Gallery".

The wall, or officially the **Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart** by East Germany's GDR, wasn't built to repel invasion as the name suggests, but as an emergency effort to keep their own population in. Flight to the west was so bad that it was compromising the viability of the country's economy, with departees disproportionately of working age and professionally skilled.

Khrushchev and Ulbricht conspired to close the border in August 1961 despite the inevitable damage it would do to communism's PR. The wall started life as barbed wire entanglements on August 13th ("Barbed Wire Sunday") and a few refinements later would became the _Grenzmauer 75_ (Border Wall 1975) of 45,000 prefab concrete blocks that we recognize today.

**At the begining of 1989, GDR leader Erich Honecker predicted that the wall would stand stand strong for 50 or 100 more years**, but that same year, a refugee crisis pressured the East German government to revise crossing regulations with a provision for private round trips. Miscommunication in the party's hierarchy caused a spokesman to suggest that the new rules would come into effect immediately, when they were supposed to activate the following day to provide time for border guards to be briefed. Televised broadcasts prompted huge gatherings at the wall's six checkpoints demanding to cross. As pressure continued to build, the vastly outnumbered soldiers would eventually allow it as no one was willing to authorize the use of lethal force.

Since then, sections of the wall have been exported around the world and can be found [everywhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Berlin_Wall_segments#Indonesia) from Manitoba to Indonesia to Estonia. Graffiti had been a common fixture on the west side of the wall for some time, but graffiti on its _east_ side, like that pictured below is new, appearing only after the '89 collapse.
