There was a time when the hustle and bustle at the front of of this building was palpable. Lyft served as the primary mode of transportation for many well-heeled employees, and frequent rideshare pickups and dropoffs competed for space with a busy bikelane and a street which was rarely _not_ in gridlock during any core hours of the day. Now, the streets and sidewalks are so empty that you can practically see tumbleweeds blowing down them, and like much of San Francisco's SOMA district, the building is too, and won't be occupied anytime soon. No longer with the benefit of full-time security, the whole courtyard's been boarded over to prevent it from becoming a full scale encampment.

This was my last Stripe office, fourth (I think?) in the series after an early startup one that I never visited, [Pioneer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_Building_(San_Francisco)) in the Mission, and [Ivy](/fragments/ivy) in China Basin. By the time I left it'd already been slated for closure for some time in anticipation of the upcoming campus being constructed down at Oyster Point in South San Francisco.

It was one of those years. Step out of the airport and straight into -30C (-22F) weather. The air is biting. The roads are quiet (even in Canada few people venture out in this).

This view is from my room at the Marriott Delta downtown. Front and center below me are the conspicuous _Brotherhood of Mankind_ sculptures, which although small from this vantage, stand more than 20 feet tall. Walking down amongst them gives you an idea of what walking amongst giants would feel like ([a few more photos](https://everydaytourist.ca/calgary-visitor-information/brotherhood-of-mankind-sculpture-successfully-evokes-a-sense-of-brotherhoodnbsp)). I grew up with the installation as an ever-present part of the background (every Calgarian will instantly recognize them as the iconic logo of the Calgary Board of Education) and took it for granted, but looking it from a more objective perspective today, it's one of the best pieces of modern public artwork I've seen in any city worldwide (and far more inspired than [what passes for art](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/travelling-light-calgary) in Calgary these days).

With bags jammed full of Xmas stuff I elected not to bring a camera, so this photo shot on iPhone 14. The iPhone's camera gets better every year and is orders of magnitude better than the first phone cameras, but especially when you zoom in on detail, you see that it's still got a long way to go. Everything looks so soft. I should be reevaluating my gear choices. If your kit is expansive enough that you're finding yourself leaving it at home when you vacation, then you have the wrong kit. I learned this lesson ten years ago, but apparently have to learn it again.

Columbus Tower's so close to the tourist parts of San Francisco (Chinatown, North Beach) that it's a building that many visitors to the city have accidentally seen before just by virtue of being here. It's a conspicuous fixture on Columbus St a few short blocks from North Beach, and when viewed from the famous Columbus and Broadway intersection, the Transamerica Pyramid towers up behind it.

Not so obvious is its notable history -- built right around the 1906 quake, it was slow to open after extensive damange to the construction site. It housed a corrupt San Francisco politican (even moreso than the ones we have today -- [convicted 14 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abe_Ruef) for bribery) and a famous stand-up comedy club before being sold to Francis Ford Coppola, upon which it became the post-SOMA headquarters for [American Zoetrope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Zoetrope), co-founded by George Lucas.

Zeotrope was responsible for production only for Lucas' pre-Lucasfilm movies like _THX 1138_ and _American Graffiti_, but most of the Coppola family films, including _The Godfather_ series, _Apocalypse Now_, and _Lost in Translation_ by Sofia Coppola (still my favorite movie).

Yesterday was the grand opening of San Francisco's new Muni line, the [Central Subway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Subway_(San_Francisco), connecting Chinatown and SOMA, ending a few blocks from the Giants stadium.

Along with many other locals, I went down to give it a test run. The new stations are deep, spacious, clean (for now), and built with a keen eye for design -- the mural at Chinatown (main image) is particularly nice.

I used to joke that this is the subway I'd never see. Having started in 2010, before I got to the city, and which seemed like it'd only finish after I'd left. It was supposed to open in December 2018, which was pushed to December 2019, then to February 2020, then to mid-2021, then to late 2021, and finally to 2022. And although the city is claiming to have hit the 2022 target, it's on technicality at best. It's running only as a pilot through the end of the year -- available only for weekend service, and not connecting to other lines.

The good news is that it's a useful route, and had it finished closer to target, I might've been a daily rider over to Stripe's old Townsend office. The bad news is that despite ambitious plans for future extensions that'd take it all the way to the Presidio, between major time and budget overruns on it and the Van Ness rapid lane (3 years behind schedule) and a struggling budget, this might be San Francisco's last major infrastructure project for a long time.

Famously, instead of building out a sterile office park out in Redmond or Mountain View, Bezos committed to downtown Seattle, and the South Lake Union are in particular.

citizenM South Lake Union, my hotel in Seattle. A tad more affordable than other places in the area, you quickly find out why -- the rooms are modern and space-efficient, but they're the size of a tack -- maybe a hundred square feet. Perfectly stackable rectangles, a full fifty of them fit on one floor of the modestly sized building.

But it's got some nice touches. Self check-in works well, and a full bank of half a dozen terminals means no lines. A generous common room with beautiful decor encourages guests to get out of their rooms and mingle downstairs. Badging into a room brings on all lights inside automatically, so no fumbling for switches. And while each light gets a switch for individual control, two master switches -- one by the bed and one by the exit -- light or extinguish them all simultaneously. Not exactly trascendant product craftsmanship, but having applied a modicum of thought to layout and design puts citizenM in the top bracket amongst its peers.

Staying in cities is expensive and getting moreso. Predictably, AirBnB has equalized in cost with hotels, and hotel prices are going up, showing ~8.5% inflation YoY. Thanks to the absence of Prop 13, Seattle uses its inner city land better than San Francisco, but it still got me thinking about how the lion's share of revenue produced by an increasingly productive city ends up going to land owners and rent. A piece [by Lars Doucet on Georgism](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/does-georgism-work-is-land-really) ([podcast form](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fKfz9Mkzv4)) makes the case that land value tax is a superior model to property tax.

Yesterday, drove from Seattle to Westport, a small town on Washington's coast.

I was lucky to join what'd been a prearranged trip for none other than ... mushroom foraging. Our target was [_Amanita muscaria_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanita_muscaria), which even if you're a mycology novice like myself, you'll recognize by its distinctive red and white spots, made unforgettable by Super Mario and the Smurfs.

Amanitas have some pscychoactive properties, but between their toxicity and the relative mildness of the effect, outlawing them was never a priority like it was for [psilocybin mushrooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushroom).

We spent the rest of the day walking around the beach and swinging by the harbor for fish and chips and crab melt. Westport is a quaint town with a rural feel, and I found it darkly amusing that this would be prime real estate up in ill-weathered Canada, but goes largely ignored in America despite being only a few hours drive from Seattle (metro population ~4M).

Later, continuing [Spring '83 implementation](https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/specifying-spring-83/), I wrote [neospring-bridge](https://github.com/brandur/neospring-bridge), which cross-posts this feed to [neospring](https://github.com/brandur/neospring) as a board (try `curl https://neospring.brandur.org/2c98169d0b6fa73cab5a830be8dde53c5f388d5c6f8e6f756b6b6dbcc83e1124`).

Not Waterloo, Washington. Today, investigating Seattle neighborhoods, I did a grand loop of inner Seattle -- starting on the University of Washington campus, up through the University District, west to Green Lake and onto Phinney Ridge, then down through Fremont and back along the west shore of Lake Union until I was back in Amazon central (South Lake Union).

Seattle's a nice city, but wow, also a busy one. From Belltown to Ballard, every road is loud and fast, and apparently a thoroughfare to somewhere else. Walking around West Lake, I'm not sure I've seen a busier park in my life. Looking at a map it makes sense -- hundreds of thousands of adjacent residents with only a handful of local park options to choose from, and falling back on what they can.

There's got to be a slower-paced neighborhood around here, but one that's not too far out in the 'burbs right? I have another half dozen yet unexplored recommendations. We'll see what the next few days yield.

This morning, got [most of a Spring '83 server](https://github.com/brandur/neospring) implementation done. It deploys automatically to GCP, but it took a couple hours of futzing around to get there.

You'll have to give me a break on photo quality for this one -- it's hard getting something good through the foggy glass of a plane window.

This is [Mount Rainier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rainier), the tallest mountain in Washington state and the Cascade mountain range, and also one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world. It's on the list of [Decade Volcanoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade_Volcanoes) thanks to its history of large, destructive eruptions and near proximity to a dense populzation zone. Wikipedia almost notes that it's the most topologically prominent peak in the contiguous US, dwarfing everything else around it and having quite a striking effect on the eye.

I just landed in Seattle. It's colder than expected. Like colder than it rightfully should be in any west coast city. Luckily, I learned from [my mistake in New York](/nanoglyphs/033-heroku#new-york) and came equipped with a variety of cold weather gear this time around. I haven't had a chance to do much yet besides check into my hotel and head over to the flagship Amazon Go store, which was quite busy, but appeared to be about 5% shoppers, and 95% senior Amazon staff chatting in small circles, lauding each other on their own ingenuity. Still, it was nice seeing a downtown that'd regained some of its lost vibrancy.

I got a coffee, along with a note saying that Amazon is "working on my receipt", but nothing since. I suspect it might be a Mechanical Turk who ends up piecing together my bill from video rather than the finely tuned neural nets of a hyper-sophisticated ML cluster, but I might be a cynic. On my way out, someone handed me a free banana from a cart parked next to a geodesic dome.

Last weekend I wrote a [Spring '83 key generator](https://github.com/brandur/spring83-keygen), and on the flight got maybe halfway to a working server implementation. Tomorrow, more Seattle, more Spring '83, and work time spent on SSO and polish on a forthcoming metrics product for Bridge.

The first ever Stripe [Sessions](https://stripe.com/sessions) in 2017, which I don't think I think I was supposed to be attending, but for which I was given a spot at the last second.

As I was looking at these, I was wishing that I'd written more down about the period since I didn't remember much anymore, only to realize that I'd been good about writing journal entries around then, and had a long one from that day. Most of it's unpublishable, but here's an excerpt about employee orientation:

> They gave us the usual spiel about how we should never get more specific than saying that we process "billions of dollars for hundreds of thousands of businesses", and said that we shouldn't say anything about the technology behind Sigma (to add mystique and imply that it's built on a powerful, secret platform proprietary to Stripe).

It was the launch day for [Stripe's Sigma](https://stripe.com/sigma), which would be announced as part of a Jobs-esque event keynote.

Stripe's [_Increment_ magazine](https://increment.com/on-call/) had just launched a few months earlier, and you can see a few of the issues of _On-call (#1)_ laid out. I'd thought _Increment_ was a mangificient idea, but my instinct nowadays is more akin to finding the nearest shredder. The whole issue was written _about_ on-call in an organizational sense, but with very little input from the people who _actually were on-call_. This was reflective of Stripe's top-down attitude towards engineering resources, which were interchangeable cogs whose worth went as far as the specific functions they performed. An engineer's on-call wasn't a service to be respected by the org -- it was a mandated duty, and one with a 5-minute SLA.

These photos are five years olds, but I've had Stripe on the mind because [they've been in the news recently](https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/ceo-patrick-collisons-email-to-stripe-employees).

This one's of a snowy trail up in St. Albert, near Edmonton, Canada. This is where my grandmother lived for many years after moving out of Edmonton proper and before moving down to a facility near my parents in Calgary. One of its most distinctive qualities was a small nearby lake surrounded by some nice trails, and which I have some fond memories of walking during various season with the rest of the family.

A few photos taken along one of those trails as the season's first seasons were starting to arrive.

Similarly to the High Line, it's elevated three meters above the surrounding streets, and that vertical separation creates an effect of peaceful isolation from surrounding traffic.

I came across Nordbahnhof purely by accident as I was touring the area northwest of mitte, and was glad I did.

The first few days of my stay are spent in Friedrichshain along the Spree. Jetlagged beyond belief, I take a walk at 5 AM and realize that I'm staying next to the longest continuous section of the [Berlin Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall) that's still standing, known as the "East Side Gallery".

The wall, or officially the **Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart** by East Germany's GDR, wasn't built to repel invasion as the name suggests, but as an emergency effort to keep their own population in. Flight to the west was so bad that it was compromising the viability of the country's economy, with departees disproportionately of working age and professionally skilled.

Khrushchev and Ulbricht conspired to close the border in August 1961 despite the inevitable damage it would do to communism's PR. The wall started life as barbed wire entanglements on August 13th ("Barbed Wire Sunday") and a few refinements later would became the _Grenzmauer 75_ (Border Wall 1975) of 45,000 prefab concrete blocks that we recognize today.

**At the begining of 1989, GDR leader Erich Honecker predicted that the wall would stand stand strong for 50 or 100 more years**, but that same year, a refugee crisis pressured the East German government to revise crossing regulations with a provision for private round trips. Miscommunication in the party's hierarchy caused a spokesman to suggest that the new rules would come into effect immediately, when they were supposed to activate the following day to provide time for border guards to be briefed. Televised broadcasts prompted huge gatherings at the wall's six checkpoints demanding to cross. As pressure continued to build, the vastly outnumbered soldiers would eventually allow it as no one was willing to authorize the use of lethal force.

Since then, sections of the wall have been exported around the world and can be found [everywhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Berlin_Wall_segments#Indonesia) from Manitoba to Indonesia to Estonia. Graffiti had been a common fixture on the west side of the wall for some time, but graffiti on its _east_ side, like that pictured below is new, appearing only after the '89 collapse.
