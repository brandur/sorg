Six weeks ago, I [started tracking my energy input and
output](/fragments/one-week), which I followed up [two](/fragments/two-weeks)
and [three](/fragments/three-weeks) weeks in. I'm now six weeks into the habit,
and although I have no intention of stopping the practice, I won't be writing
about it anymore because all these check-ins are starting to look alike.

Here are weeks four, five, and six:

| Day       | Food    | Exercise | Net Relative to 1,200 Cal Goal |
| :-------: | :-----: | :------: | :----------------------------: |
| June 27   | 2,770   | 1,753    | -183                           |
| June 28   | 2,399   | 1,736    | -537                           |

| **Total** |         |          | **+1,263**                     |

| Day       | Food    | Exercise | Net Relative to 1,200 Cal Goal |
| :-------: | :-----: | :------: | :----------------------------: |
| July 11   | 2,058   | 289      | +569                           |
| July 12   | 2,597   | 825      | +572                           |
| July 13   | 2,156   | 1,194    | -238                           |
| July 14   | 1,424   | 1,344    | -1,120                         |
| July 15   | 2,716   | 1,238    | +278                           |
| July 16   | 3,274   | 2,029    | +45                            |
| July 17   |    |     | +331                           |
| **Total** |         |          | **+282**                       |

Of note: many weeks I don't make targets. However, there's no question that the
tracking has had a positive effect in that I've eliminated pop, juice, energy
drinks, and unhealthy snacks (potato chips and the like) from my diet, and am
getting some kind of strenuous exercise roughly seven times a week. I'm still
drinking alcohol socially, and if I miss a calorie target, it's that practice
which is almost universally responsible. Dialing it back to a hard maximum of
two drinks in a 24 hour period [1] is a reasonable next step.

My last weigh in was XXX lbs., down from 176 lbs., which means that I was
pretty close to my goal of losing 2 lbs. per week (XX lbs. compared to 12
lbs.). More qualitatively, my clothes are looser and muscle definition
improved, which is a more important result than the numbers.

After six weeks, I have no intention of stopping food and exercise tracking,
but given that these write-ups are starting to look very alike, I will stop
making these periodic (and only very nominally interesting) check-ins.
