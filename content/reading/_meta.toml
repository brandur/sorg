A tiny pocket book that's the perfect format for carrying about and skimming in a session or two. It's quite short, and no tips in here will change your life, but I found the book a helpful reminder to get out and do things and to publish what you did.

There's a couple sequences where he (or someone being quoted) glorifies lockdowns (and how they were so conducive to being interesting), which drives me up the wall, but the content is reasonably good beyond that.

The idea of reading republished journals sounds like a tiresome concept, but it works with editing and attention to detail. Jordan's journal entries are succinct and offer a fascinating window into the early era of game development, with his well-traveled life acting as seasoning for the story. Beautifully curated media assets and other accompanying materials are sprinkled througout to keep it even more engaging.

I'd never played the original game when I was young so after finishing the book I went to try it on a DOS emulator. Games have come a long way and you have to grade them according to their time, but still, wow, absolutely terrible. Stick to the book.

As a big Crichton fan, I was surprised not to have found this book before. The title is a bit of a misnomer -- travelogues make up maybe a third of the book with the rest of it being able Crichton's couple years practicing medicine, thoughts on paranormal phenomena, and vignettes from his life in LA.

The psychic stuff feels quite odd to read today, but makes sense in context as it would've been very en vogue during the 80s when the book was written. Crichton's obviously a thoughtful guy, so there are a few stories that really make you wonder. For example, like when Crichton attended a spoon bending party (in the style of Uri Geller) and claimed that everyone there was able to bend spoons with their minds by the end of the night. He wasn't lying about it, but rather had managed to convince himself that it was real, and a contemporary reader is left wondering simply: what happened there?

The stories are entertaining enough and it's worth a quick read, but it's not a heavy hitter like a lot of Crichton's other work.

Rowling's an obnoxiously talented writer. I rarely read mysteries, but keep finding myself gravitating back to these Cormoran Strike books. They're long, but the length gives the story time to examine the mystery in play from all angles, and develop characters into believable people. Like other series entries, the resolution is an epic crescendo of converging clues and storylines, magically orchestrated. _Running Grave_'s subject is a cult, and anyone passingly familiar with like organizations in real life recognizes its background and practices as highly believable.

This was easily my most anticipated book of 2023. Lewis had been embedded with SBF throughout the entire duration of the fraud, and putting those observations to work after his arrest could lead to the greatest rollercoaster tell all in a generation.

Instead, we got the hardest PR spin of the generation. The entire book builds up Sam as a misunderstood genius who's intelligence is head and shoulders above his peers, and _so_ smart that his actions appear inscrutable to us mere mortals. His arrest and the ironclad criminal case brought against him are functionally a footnote brought up in the book's last few pages. Not a word is wasted in contemplation of the victims of his fraud, $8 billion of whose savings disappeared.

Instead of waiting for a more complete picture after Sam's trial had concluded, Lewis opted to release the book as it was just getting underway, which is hard to interpret as anyother other than a last ditch Hail Mary to sway the opinion of the jury pool.

Regardless of Lewis' motivation behind writing such a single dimensional, extraordinarily biased account, I suspect he's going to find that credibility is hard to build, but easy to burn. I thoroughly enjoyed _The Big Short_ and _Boomerang_, but will never going to look at a Michael Lewis book the same way again.

No conclusion, no thesis, no raison d'être, just cultural references ad nauseam with an implication that there's some great wisdom below the surface.

  review = "Klein's thesis around polarization and some of its roots is generally correct, but if you stop to think about what's being written, some of the disingenuity comes into closer focus. For example, the book starts out talking about Trump (what else), but immediately lays down the premise that the reason for Trump's rise is that the electorate is bad. Not touched upon at all is the Democratic Party putting its thumb on the scale to jam their favored candidate in place, a person with decades worth of dubious behavior in DC that practically nobody in America likes. Klein is obsessed with identity politics, or rather the idea that it doesn't exist, and if it did, it's something that everybody is doing, gaslighting by fiat that there isn't something quite toxic that the modern left has made a major part of their core platform. The book tries to appear mostly unbiased throughout, but by the back third Klein is into overt theses of \"the Democratic Party is fundamentally good and the Republic Party is fundamentally bad\", which he \"proves\" by showing that more of the mainstream media favors the Democratic Party. Just amazing."

  review = "One of the scariest, and most important books of the contemporary age — Douthat makes the case that rich societies have entered a plateau similar to one seen at the end of the Roman Empire, wherein they stay quite rich, but have lost their edge in innovation, creativity, and even the ability to sustain themselves biologically. He argues these points very convincingly, and indeed, I find it hard to believe that anyone could read this book with something akin to an open mind and not have to acknowledge that Douthat's analysis is correct, even if reluctantly. Its review bombing is telling — if the book's thesis is indeed right, then we as a civilization are in serious crisis, and without a lot of compelling options for extricating ourselves from it. That is absolutely _terrifying_. Hitting the book with a two-star review over sentiment rather than content is one of the few forms of cope that's readily available."

In a nutshell, it's a travel/life memoir rewritten as fiction apparently to avoid legal problems, which has the side effect that there's not much in the way of overaching story to speak of, and although the travel experiences are a window into a period of American history that isn't coming back, they're not exactly enthralling either.

The book sticks to the facts and manages to stay quite neutral, but you come out of it with a strong impression that the Fed's been the most important contributor to practically every economic crisis in the past thirty years, and like many federal institutions, has fallen victim to short-term wishful thinking over planning for longer term, well-distributed prosperity and stability. For example, while the Fed wasn't any of the directly precipitating factors that led to the 2008 financial crisis (e.g. they weren't selling risky repackaged ARMs), by keeping interest rates close to zero and providing cheap money for so long, they were the major reason that banks were pushed so far down the risk curve in search of higher returns. My one missive is that the book was written too early to cover our latest 2022 developments of high inflation and the Fed finally engaging in non-trivial rate hikes (0.75) for the first time in modern history — wouldn't been interesting to get Leonard's take on this."

  review = "Wow, what a read — let me just say that if Zeihan is right, we're all in a whole lot of trouble (or at least the kids we're not having are). To really boil things all the way down, Zeihan's two core theses are that (1) having failed to sustain healthy demographic distributions (largely thanks to industrialization), almost every country on Earth is facing impending demographic collapse as there are not nearly enough young to support the old, and we're well passed the point that anything could be done about the problem; and (2) the US will withdraw as the protector of the world's waterways, which will sharply curb world trade. This will leave countries more inward facing to source the resources and production they need to sustain their 21st century lifestyles, but most countries don't have anything close to there wherewithal to do so, with the result being that the quality of live they got used to under under globalism will become sharply diminished.\n\nHe's bullish on the United States and a couple other countries like France, and notably extremely bearish on China, who he believes is in for a reckoning as the aftereffects of decades worth of one-child policy come due in the form of a catastrophic demographic implosion (along with a host of other problems they're facing). I have to say that even six months ago I would've been highly dubious as China's trajectory didn't seem be moving in any direction except up, but between the trouble they've had in their financial and housing markets over the last few months, combined with a truly insane Covid Zero policy that seems to indicate that Xi's fired every smart person who might've contradicted him, these days I'm inclined to believe Zeihan's claims.\n\nThe whole thing is meticulously researched, and there aren't any obvious holes to be poked in the vast majority of suppositions (as concerning as that is). The one big one that smelled a little off to me is the claim that America's navy is what acts as essentially the sole guarantor for global shipping safety, a macro thesis on which many of the other claims in the book are contingent. He does cite a lot of information about the naval fleets of other countries including China aren't up to job, but I'll still be looking for some second opinions. But other than that, I suspect all the references check out."

Although Tony's later year projects may have been more questionable, I'd contend that his work to revitalize downtown Vegas as to produce a vital urban community may be one of the better things a billionaire (or near billionaire in his case) has ever spent their money on. There's the obvious story of substance abuse, but there's a subplot here of how Covid-related lockdowns were extremely harmful to people prone to abuse — Hsieh's case is one that'll have a book written about it, but it makes you wonder of the untold millions for whom nothing will ever be said."

As far as the book is concerned — it's a great historical artifact, but is largely made up of freeform entries from Moitessier's journal, and is pretty long-winded and undirected.

Two major things that occurred to me while reading this: (1) the TV series follows the book _very_ closely — I already had all the high points even having watched this season years ago, and (2) in a rare turnaround, the TV series might actually be the better version of the media. The crew in the book come off as a little too campy — Captain Holden and his Rogue Squad of solar system-spelunking mavericks aboard the rough-and-tough Rocinante. Watching the TV version on the other hand, you get more of an impression of a realistic and capable flight squad surviving in a hostile environment. The show also makes some of the characters really come alive compared to the book — especially Wes Chatham as Amos and Frankie Adams as Bobbie. Still, nice to get the extra detail that prose conveys. e.g. Watching the show, I don't think I bothered to look up what a \"PDC\" was until about season five."

The characters are so single-dimensional that it was hard to care about what happened to any of them, and almost every last one a trope — OP female friend, old librarian, refined high society new lover, etc. The protagonist sleepwalks through a story that doesn't offer much by way of conflict or plot — the characters meander through Alice In Wonderland environments until eventually it resolves, but not by virtue of anything that anyone did. A lot of the prose is genuinely clever, and the conceit of alternative chapters that tell fables is intriguing (although overplayed), but not enough so to redeem it."

The effort and research that went into reconstructing Crowhurt's voyage based on misleading radio messages and a combination of partially complete and doctored ship logs is amazing. The book is not only thorough, but also very objective — Crowhurst's ultimate fate can't be known with perfect certainty, but the authors establish what they think is the most reasonable conclusion and exhaustively list the supporting evidence for it. Other possibilities are considered as well, with each one dismissed with sound reasoning. The one negative I'll say is that the book might be a little _too_ thorough — I found myself wishing that they'd packed the story into half the length or so."

In my mind, the book's only major weakness is that a lot of the characters are a little trope-y, especially the ones on Earth. I also hope the 2nd edition comes with a schematic of the Hail Mary ship, which would be a wonderful addition, and help to illustrate how the centrifuge works, the description of which didn't quite make it through to me."

The race itself is a little odd in its apparent informality and big random x-factors, and the book's race year's finish a little anti-climactic, but this is a well-written account that had me laugh out loud at various points. Had never even heard of the Derby's existence before starting the book, but found it quite fascinating by the end."

Troubled Blood is a solid mystery that's much more procedural than your traditional \"genius\" detective genre, with a lot of it being through-the-paces talking to people, studying material, and trying at length to connect dots. It's also about the detectives themselves, and their relationship with each other. It comes together well at the end, but I found it a little more prolonged than it had to be."

Unfortunately, those overtones impact the story in negative ways. e.g. How convenient that every surviving human being fits so cleanly in the good camp or the evil camp. e.g. If you pay attention, you'll notice that none of the protagonists actually do much of anything to resolve the plot, especially in the back half of the book.

Sections are interspersed with dialog between Polo and the Khan. I had a hard time rating this one because while the prose is wonderful, the writing suggests a profundity of hidden depth (in the themes of the cities of each section, or the relationship between the different \"categories\" of city), but it's not clear whether that depth actually exists. It's either a 3 or 4 star book, and worth reading not only because it's good, but also because it's short and to the point."

It hits the sweet spot between good narrative and mystery — the entire time you're reading, you're racking your brain trying to figure out what's going on as the text segments never quite convey enough information. By the end, you're constructed a view of the story and the world that's partially complete, but with gaps that are purposely left unknown and up to the reader's interpretation. As with other works by Stålenhag, I'm rating this one well because it's excellent for what it is, but keep in mind it's a fairly short work, with a reading time of ~1 hour."

Rowling proves just how good popular fiction can be — at the risk of sounding dramatic, a society where the mainstream admires book like these with intricate storylines, three dimension characters, and creativity in droves is the best version of humanity that we can hope for. _The Deathly Hallows_ also prove against the grain that it's possible to produce a strong end to a series even where expectations are higher than the moon — something that's easy to forget with recent, popular fumbles like _Game of Thrones_. Its pacing is great (read: not all just a long action scene), it provides a new level of lore for the world (the idiosyncrasies of wand ownership), and the story reads like it was planned out from the beginning (a much higher bar than it appears to be)."

Most others seem to be chasing much more questionable values like maintaining an illusion of work that's really just frantic busy-ness, or hyper-growth-at-all-costs which leads to a top-heavy pyramid that's 95% communication and 5% productive progress. I, for one, appreciate that."

Most travel adventure books are a mixed bag of mildly amusing anecdotes or situations that have been exaggerated to the point of fiction for dramatic effect, but Paul's narrative is light on that, and his quirky encounters are legitimately funny. There's enough books about travel in Japan that for all intents and purpose they're their own genre at this point, and if that's the case, this is one of the best I've read therein."

  review = "Worth the read for the many historical anecdotes that it covers, both from ancient history and that which is much more recent. Ferguson is an expert historian and it really comes through. His take on more modern events is also refreshingly pragmatic — he doesn't fall into the trap of expressing undue optimism about everything to be more palatable to the general public and sell more book copies. For example, the chapter that shows how states trend toward becoming heavily bureaucratic and thus capture monstrous amounts of potential productivity in massive overhead should be mandatory reading for anyone living in a democratic country.\n\nMy one complaint about the book is by going back through many key historical events in history and retrofitting the \"hierarchy versus network\" dichotomy onto them, the author ends up cheapening his own ideas. Many of the comparisons feel forced and/or unnecessary."

Unfortunately, something about the pacing is a little off, and I never got to the point where I was a reading it fluently. Its worse fault is its obfuscated prose — about 50 manufactured words are thrown at the reader right from the beginning (gogol, q-dot, Sobornost, quptlink, phoboi, tzaddikim, Oubliette, zoku, gevulot, etc.), and entire paragraphs are unintelligble. By the end of the book you've built up a rough feeling as to what most of it means, but even by then, the majority have never really been adequately explained. It's possible for a book to do a great job with some artificial vocabulary, but there's too much of it."

  review = "\"Walkaway\" is further proof that nobody thinks about the future like Cory Doctorow does. The imagined future isn't just possible, but feels within reach, and is modeled on a trajectory that originates from the author's keen sense of technology today. Many of its elements are pulled directly from ideas that we have today like wikis, anonymizers, version control, gamification, etc. and extended to produce an impressive vista that manages to be both utopian and dystopian at the same time.\n\nI'm giving it a lower rating mostly because all the characters are so insufferable. The highly embellished banter gets tiring to read after a while, and you just find yourself wishing that Cory would pick up a few habits from Cormac McCarthy. The book is also heavy handed on political statements: everyone's on the LGBT spectrum, and every female character is a Mary Sue incarnate.

He also goes into some interesting details around comparable projects in New York, Paris, and even Houston.\n\nI downrated it a little bit because while talking about specific projects was interesting and the despite the project's broad thesis, he doesn't present a cohesive strategy that will do anything than apply a few bandaids on a problem of true national scale."

Twenty pages in I could tell that I wanted to quit, but kept going. Fifty pages in I was bored. A hundred pages in, my stomach was churning. Two hundred pages in, I was disgusted. Five hundred pages in, I'd reached a state of zen wherein my eyes skimmed hundreds of words per minute of the most contemptible prose ever committed to paper, while still maintaining some semblance of mental integrity.\n\nDhalgren is proof that no matter how bad a book is, there will be self-proclaimed aficionados who will champion it as great literature only because it's so dense that it's inaccessible to the majority of the population. It's not about the quality of text, it's about how being in an appreciating minority unlocks access to a feeling of exclusive superiority. Dhalgren doesn't have a single redeeming quality — there's no cohesive plot, no moment of awe at it comes to a conclusion, not a single interesting character, and the only word that can be accurately applied to describe the dialog throughout is \"garbage\".\n\nHere's some of the most practical good advice that you'll get in your lifetime: read the plot synopsis in Wikipedia, and stop there. It's actually a little on the long side because every one of the book's original ideas can be easily summed up in three sentences. Use the dozens of hours you saved yourself from slogging through 800+ pages of one of the worst books ever written to do literally anything else: make love, write your novel, run a marathon, go to the gym.

It gives a few pieces of advice that interesting and not in the array of broadly distributed knowledge on the subject.\n\nNear the end of a book built entirely on subjective advice and anecdote, Kawasaki's added a section on how to avoid being overly enchanted by anecdotes.

The in-depth yet approachable explanations of TCP and TLS were especially good.\n\nMy only complaint is that the subject matter covered seemed to be somewhat arbitrary -- a huge portion of the book was devoted to describing various types of wireless standards, but without really making it into that much depth on wireless communication. It was still quite interesting though -- I finally understand the difference between 3GPP and 3GPP2 standards and how they're related to each other."

The Hyperion series may be unparalleled in its imagination, expanse, and mystery, with this first book being an anthology of sorts, containing a variety of stories from a cast of characters whose backstories are progressively revealed. A favorite aspect of this book is how Simmons drops you in hot with minimal explanation, and you're left to build up a comprehensive view of the universe over the course of the novel — it's easy to get this wrong by over-explaining or not explaining enough, but Hyperion strikes a perfect balance."

  review = "Clearly Carriger's recipe for this book was Pride and Prejudice mixed with Twilight and a little steampunk thrown in to make the setting a tad more original. Final product makes Twilight look a literary accomplishment.\n\nThe author spends so much time describing how characters are stereotypes through statements, rather than have those characters actually behave in that way. e.g. \"The love interest is super manly,\" \"the vampire friend is so gay,\" \"the second-in-command of the wolf pack is that tweed jacket professor type,\" \"Tarabotti is SUCH a witty conversationalist that no one messes with her,\" \"the American scientist is a weak man.\" It's tiring to read.\n\nThe romance is in a league of its own. The love interest is rich, an earl, big and strong, head of the werewolf pack, head of the government's supernatural division, Scottish, gruff, and the over-idealized definition of manly in every respect. His interest in the heroine is apparently that she is such a clever conversationalist (again, stated many times, but never proved through dialog) and isn't afraid to challenge and question himself, or anyone, including the Queen of England. Pulp romance at its best.\n\nThis novel by itself was enough to convince me to completely ignore Goodreads' ratings for choosing books to read. At just under 4 stars, this book is rated significantly better than tens of thousands of far superior works."
