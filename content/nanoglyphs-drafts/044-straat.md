I ~never write two issues of _Nanoglyph_ this close together, but yesterday's blast was running long, so I figured I'd follow up with a brief point release.

Last issue covered [Rails World 2025](/nanoglyphs/rails-world-2025). Its closing party was at a museum in Amsterdam Noord called [STRAAT](https://straatmuseum.com/en/about-us). I thought there was a change it'd be pretty cool, but I wasn't prepared for it all. It was legitimately some of the most beautiful art I've ever seen, and showcased in a masterful way reminiscent of a Peter Lik gallery in Las Vegas, where the art is good, but the real trick is the perfect lighting that makes it pop to an otherworldly degree.

The venue bills its contents as "street art and graffiti", but given that the word "graffiti" is basically synonymous with "tag" in the contemporary age as the practice has almost entirely descended into a skill-free endeavor involving a single can of black spray paint or a stencil, most of the work at STRAAT would be at roughly the 99.999999% percentile of skill in the street art discipline. I'd just call it "art".

Shopify was sponsoring again, and had commissioned custom beer cans for the event. I'm not sure if this was more lax European regulations at work, but they'd done a few clever things like prepouring many of the drinks at the bar and having common beers a self-serve ordeals which meant that there were never any lineups to wait in. I've been to enough of these things now that it's this sort of detail that stands out. At events that are less well run you end up spending 50% of your time talking to other people and 50% in various lines.

The place was gorgeous, so this is issue is mostly an excuse to publish a few more photos from Amsterdam. See below for that. I also got an iPhone Air.

## iPhone Air (#iphone-air)

Years ago after Apple instituted their fairly generous trade-in program, I got into the bad habit of buying a new iPhone every year. I have no regrets from the first couple years of doing it, but my mistake was not stopping when Apple stopped innovating. For some time now the announcements we get in September boil down to:

* The number on the A* chip is incremented by one like A18 → A19 (unnoticeable).
* X% better camera performance (unnoticeable).
* One or two new colors (and one or two existing colors removed)
* One novelty item. Last year for example we got the "Camera Control" button, which at first I was a tiny bit excited for, but turned out to be terrible (ranges from too sensitive to not sensitive enough; fails completely if one microgram worth of moisture is within a radius of approximately ten square miles).

And yet, I did it again.

This decision largely boiled down to (1) Apple's new signature "Desert Titanium" color I'd ordered last year turned out to be far uglier in person than in their promotional materials, and (2) the iPhone Air seemed to legitimately be the most interesting thing Apple's done with the iPhone in years.

Despite waking up at 5 AM to place the order, I wasn't even looking forward to receiving _that_ much because it's a little bit of work to rebuild a phone, and now involves me having to transfer four separate MFA credentials over for work.

September 19th rolled around. I went to pick up the phone and was _delighted_ to be in for a surprise. I knew it'd be thin. I knew it'd be light. But I didn't expect it to be _this_ thin and _this_ light. Pictures and videos don't do it justice. It's thinner and lighter in person to an impressive degree, and very little is sacrificed to get it there. It's my favorite new iPhone model since iPhone X.

### Battery (#battery)

There are a couple tradeoffs, but I don't find them to be a problem. The battery is nowhere near as large as in the pro models, but this works fine for me as someone who's not a heavy phone user. I've been charging my phone to [80% maximum charge](/nanoglyphs/041-15-16#iphone-15) for years now, and never had a problem. Days of heavy use will bring me close to zero, but I often have a laptop nearby in case I need an emergency top up. I don't think it'll be a problem.

### Camera (#camera)

The Air goes to one camera from three, losing the wide 24mm and telephoto 120mm lenses.

The first phone I ever took a photograph on was a [Motorola KRZR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Krzr) back in 2006, and it's extraodinary how far cameras in phones have come. It used to be that you'd accompany your photos with narration as whoever you were showing them to stared into the blurry things trying to make out what they were exactly. Nowadays, you need a trained eye to tell what's shot on a phone and what's not.

That said, I only use my phone's camera for throwaway shots or when I don't have anything else. As much as phone photography has improved over the years, I find that anything that comes out of a phone has a soft quality that I don't like, and which looks noticeably worse compared to a full frame mirrorless when blown up beyond thumbnail sizes.

So while this might affect others more than me, I'll generally still be carrying around my 5-year old Canon R6, and don't expect to notice the absence of the two extra iPhone cameras.

### Screen (#screen)

At 6.5 inches, the Air's screen lands squarely between the iPhone 17 at 6.3 inches and the 17 Pro at 6.9 inches. I like the larger form factors, but having carried the Pro for a number of years now I've always found it just a little too big as the top left side is just out of reach for my thumb. A few days later I haven't noticed the absence of the the lost 0.4" at all.

Years ago I was a big Apple fan, but in recent years it's been hard not to be a critic as Cook-era leadership has replaced the company's famous innovation with financialization. It's been so long since we got one of the breathtaking game changers like M chips, unibody MacBooks, edge-to-edge display, or the original iPhone and the revolutionary capacitive touch technology that'd alter the course of history. The iPhone Air isn't quite up there with any of those, but it's cool. My favorite Apple device in recent memory, and quite a pleasant surprise after years of mediocrity.

Until next week.
