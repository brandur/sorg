  discovery of a very classical solution.

A few years ago I took the plunge and started using
BreakTime.app. For those not familiar with it, BreakTime is
a small application designed to periodically force you to
take a break from what you're doing on your PC. It starts a
timer (configurable, but ~20 minutes), and when that
expires you're shown a full-screen modal that forces you to
take a break for the duration of another timer (~2
minutes). In an age of non-ergonomic Apple keyboards and
eye-straining glossy displays, the importance of getting
some brief respite from the hours spent in front of a
glowing screen can't be overstated. My eyes certainly
thanked me when I started using it.

BreakTime is a great concept, but its propensity to obscure
the top right quadrant of my screen while I was trying to
type commit messages, finally drove me crazy enough to
start looking for alternatives.

(This would happen all the time.)

A separate issue is that BreakTime doesn't have a lot of
sympathy for you or the work that you're doing. Whether
you're in the middle of a video call, desperately handling
a production incident, or cranking away at your latest
feature while deep in the zone, it will yank you out to its
modal; the choppy transition animation a symbol for its
callous enthusiasm.

I'm happy to say that I've found a far less invasive
solution. It makes me feel like a luddite, but manages to
keep itself out of my daily work routine while at the same
time reminding me that it's time to take a few minutes of
R&R. As a bonus, I get a beautiful piece of industrial
design to decorate my desk, and the warm knowledge that I'm
living by the same technology that Magellan used to
circumnavigate the globe.

For those interested, this is a very basic $16 [30 minute
black sand hourglass][hourglass] available via Amazon.
