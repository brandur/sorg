Many of us in technology-adjacent circles have been
grumbling for years about the continued centralization of
the web. The overwhelming trend has been for content to
gravitate towards the internet's Great Walled Gardens --
Facebook, YouTube, Medium, and company. As time marches
on, not only are those gardens getting bigger, but their
walls are growing higher. There was a time that those
platforms made motions in the direction of openness -- XMPP
support in Hangouts or Messenger for example -- but
interoperability on their part is a fading relic of a more
idealistic past.

It's not clear what it'll take to break the walls back
down, and we're not likely to bring back the exploratory,
I-have-no-idea-what-I'm-doing culture of the 90s & early
2000s, but a necessity to renewed decentralization is the
continued production of content that lives outside those
walls. A fond memory of the earlier days of the internet
was the experimentation -- people building new sites and
projects in every medium from writing to Photoshop to
interactive Flash [1].

In that spirit [2]: I just arrived in Berlin, and am
running a tiny photography and writing project called
***Sequences*** while I'm here. The format is a photograph
every day, accompanied by a few words that I'll try to keep
interesting. Think of it like an isolate, self-hosted, Ye
Olden Days version of Instagram. No likes, comments, or
react-ji -- just a channel from me to the open web in the
hopes that I can show you some cool stuff.

I'm publishing everything via <a href="/sequences.atom" class="feed-icon">feed</a> (empty for the next ~day). For anyone like me who fell off the RSS wagon after the implosion of Google Reader, I'll be <a href="https://twitter.com/brandur" class="twitter-icon">tweeting</a> new entries.

[1] Not every idea was a good one.

[2] I'm not doing quite as well on the exploratory front,
but building a Flexbox-based (still quite possibly the
single greatest innovation in CSS of all time) image
gallery, and trying a few new CSS techniques were new to
me.
