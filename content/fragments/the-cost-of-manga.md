hook: "At retail prices, catching up on One Piece would cost $8,200, and Fairy Tail $5,500. Why aren't there legitimate and affordable ways of getting started with these series?"

I recently caught up on the manga super series [One Piece][one-piece] which has
reached an extraordinary 82 volumes in length, each of which averages around
200 pages (for a total of ~16,000). While waiting for more of it to be released
I (perhaps unwisely) starting reading [Fairy Tail][fairy-tail], a series of
similarly astounding proportions at 55 volumes (~11,000 pages).

After a visit yesterday to Kinokuniya, San Francisco's Japanese bookstore and
looking at the prices on manga volumes, it got me to thinking how much it would
actually cost to read one of these series back to front. At an average of $10 a
volume, One Piece would cost $8,200 to read, and Fairy Tail $5,500. Prices
will vary depeding on where you source the books from; they'll be more
expensive at real-world stores ($11), and may be discounted on Amazon ($5 for
more recent One Piece volumes), but they're roughly right.

Especially given that the series are aimed at younger readers without a lot of
money, these numbers strike me as _big_. There's probably some expectation that
some volumes will be swapped with friends or available at a local library, but
even so getting caught up could be expensive. The price isn't too high either;
between the artwork and interesting writing, there's easily $10 worth of
content wrapped up in one of them.

Realistically, there's a considerable amount of piracy involved in getting
people on-boarded into either series because there aren't any cost-effective
legitimate solutions. The digital medium _should_ offer publishers a way to
solve this problem; perhaps by selling back issues at a fraction of the normal
price, while the last ten volumes or so stay at $10. Publishers have a natural
aversion to cheapening their content, even if it's old and has entered the long
tail its sales curve, but Steam's sales of 50-90% off (and with a proportional
boost in sales) serves as a guiding light for anyone willing to look for one.

For now, I'm lucky enough to have a library that carries complete collections,
but if I wasn't, I might not be reading manga at all.
