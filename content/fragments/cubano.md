I've recently been working on some cocktails that include egg white and came
across a good one while surfing the expanses of the World Wide Web.

The _Cubano_:

* 1 part fresh lime juice
* 1 1/2 parts Cointreau (Triple Sec)
* 3 parts Jamaican gold rum
* 1 egg white

Combine in shaker with ice. Shake well.
