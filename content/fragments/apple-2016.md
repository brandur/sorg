hook: The higher they rise, the harder they fall.

I have a complex relationship with Apple. I started using their products in
grade school, but was never a fan of any of their early line ups. In my later
years of  university, I became a convert after playing with OS X and seeing
some of the beautiful hardware that they were producing at the time (the very
first 2006 MacBook Pro running X86). The quantum leap advancement in touch
technology culminating in the release of the first iPhone added more fuel to
the fire, and since then I've championed the company at every opportunity.

For years I've been of the opinion that the only laptop a developer should
own is something out of the MacBook line. I like Linux as much of the next guy,
but between the far superior stability of OSX, the incredible battery life, and
the absolute build quality of Apple's laptops, my next computer has always been
an easy decision.

But more recently, Apple has evened out the equation through a combination of
total negligence towards most of their computing lineups, and a series of highly
impractical product and design decisions that suggest a new core value for the
company: form over function. It doesn't matter how a product works as long as
its design is a bit sleeker, its line are a little more symmetrical, or its body
a little thinner.

Specifically, these major releases come to mind:

* (March 2015) The 12" MacBook was an early hint of more to come. I actually
  really like this laptop and still use it every day, but Apple's decision to
  ship it with _one port_ was so deafly unpragmatic that we could have used it
  to predict the future at the time.

* (April 2015) The Apple Watch. Apple paraded around strong initial sales
  numbers, but let's face it, about 80% of those are now sitting in people's
  sock drawers. A device that gives you only nominal benefits over the phone
  you already have in your pocket and needs daily charging is never going to
  make it past "novelty".

* (September 2016) The removal of the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 (see
  [courage] previously). This one is a bit of a milestone because it's the
  first change that made me want to get out of a product lineup that I've
  always been very happy with. Others might say that the jack was dropped
  because Apple believes that wireless earphones are ready for prime time [1].
  More cynically, I think it's because they wanted to make the bottom of the
  iPhone symmetric.

* (November 2016) The new MacBook Pro. Obviously TouchBar is the lightning rod;
  a pointless gimmick that, after the initial novelty dies off, is going to be
  obviously useless to pretty much everyone. But the bigger red flag for me is
  the that they reduced battery capacity by 25% because the new components were
  expected to make up the difference by being 25% more power efficient (they
  didn't). Sacrificing a major practical advantage to satisfy the urge to shave
  a few mm off a computer that's already thin enough for anyone gives us a
  small window into the very concerning thought process of today's Apple.

I don't know where this leaves me. I don't really want to move out of the Apple
ecosystem, but I also don't want a TouchBar and _do want_ a headphone jack. For
now they've left a small escape with the so-called "MacBook Escape", but expect
these holes to close over time.
