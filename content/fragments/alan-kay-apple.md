hook: On locking down platforms and diluting user
  interfaces to the lowest common denominator.

I've never had as an easy of a time romanticizing Xerox
PARC and the old guard as much as many others down here do,
but this 2014 talk from Alan Kay is very thought provoking:
["Is it Complex or Did We Just Make it
Complicated?"][talk].

There are a lot of good ideas in there, but my favorite
moment is when he sets his sights on the dumbed down
interface that is iOS. He's asked about running
[Squeak][squeak] (a Smalltalk dialect) on the iPad, and
responds with:

> I'll tell you what does tick me off. Two things. The

There have been many changes since the dawn of personal
computing. Some have been tremendously positive like the
quantum leap in the raw compute power that we have
available, but not all are as encouraging. As suggested by
Alan, the walled gardens that we take for granted on
everything from our iOS apps to our browser extensions
would have been an abomination to early pioneers. So too
would the idea of diluting interfaces so that they're
universally accessible, but at the expense of any kind of
productivity gain by savvy or educated users.

We should be thinking about re-opening our platforms and
[rebooting our UX design to optimize for power
users](/interfaces). We should be using computing to push
humanity to new levels instead of constraining it to the
most modest possible baseline. There's still time to do so,
but the hour grows late indeed.
