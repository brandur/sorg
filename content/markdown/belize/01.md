Friday night, 24th St at 9 PM on Friday night, walking from Noe Valley down into the Mission. I'm on my way to the BART station to make my way up to SFO for a redeye flight, scheduled 11:59 PM to minimize off-by-one day accidents. High-end restaurants throughout Noe Valley are bustling. Descend into the Mission, and the bar scene there is just picking up steam. It's strange behind out amongst the the Friday night revelers carrying a 30-pound travel bag on my back full of clothes and dive gear. I must look like an oddity -- between hair and backpack, and given the city and time of day, bum? But not of the usual variety. Probably just a weirdo. This is San Francisco after all.

Somewhere between the age of thirty and now, I've lost my capacity to sleep on airplanes. I'd been careful all day -- waking up early, doing a long walk through the city, a run later on, packing, cleaning, and a glass of whisky, all with no naps to make sure I was as tired as possible. Still, not enough, and I finish 50 dry pages of Dostoevsky on the way to Houston. Its airport at 5 AM is peaceful, all except the security line, which is already a preview for the chaos of the day ahead. I stop in at the KLM Lounge, a fancy thing to call a human-attended procurement depo for bagels and Lays chips. Maybe there was a time when airport lounges were gilded escapes for high-class people rather than gated rooms for people like me who read The Points Guy dot com and min/max credit card rewards. Maybe not. If ever the case, it was a long time ago.

On the way to Belize City, now awake more than 24 hours, my body no longer has a choice, and I nod off a couple times. The most revitalizing half hour of sleep I've had in years. I get back to my reading project but am distracted by the teen next to me, who, totally immersed in his smartphone, is rocking out to a long series of locally downloaded YouTube 30-second meme videos, nodding his head in time with the rhythm and occasionally forming a metal pitchfork with his hand, except all _with no headphones_ or any other sound whatsoever, suggesting the knows them all so well that he can do without. This is further compounded by the fact that many of the videos appear to be sound _only_ in the common YouTube style, showing nothing but static art stills. I am absolutely mystified. I thought I knew a bit about technology and even a little about internet culture, but as seems to happen with every generation, the next one has left mine in the dust.

I'm met at the airport by Andrea and Bruce, who drive me to a waterpark called Kukumba Beach and park me there for the day. The resort, Blackbird Caye, operates on a cohort model where a fresh roster of divers rotates in on Sunday, and back out again on Saturday a week later. Peoples' flights arrive throughout the day and mine is the first one in, so we'll be waiting for passengers to trickle in through to the afternoon. Kukuma Beach is the polar opposite of a tourist trap and as cool as a waterpark as I've ever seen, with a huge slide and Tarzan swing that wouldn't be legal further north, but not having anywhere to park my luggage, I settle for eating jerk chicken and scuttling between shifting shadows to avoid sunburn. The local currency is the Belize dollar, pegged at exactly 2:1 USD, so the math is easy.

Finally, everyone has arrived, modulo four pour souls who missed their connection, and who we will be left behind for pick up the next day. They'll be trading their night in a beach villa for a highly-coveted stay at the Hartsfieldâ€“Jackson Atlanta International Airport.

As is often found in Central America, the Blackbird is a full service culture with no detail too small to be closely observed. We're ushered back into the resort's bus and we drive north ... exactly fifty feet north to be precise, after which we disembark again and load onto the _Big Bird_ for the two hour boat transit out to the remote atoll where the outpost is located.

We round a mangrove island and finally, there it is. Blackbird Caye Resort, consisting of a dock, a bar, a restaurant, and about a dozen huts splayed along the beach. People around here will joke about "island time", but this place operates like a finely-engineered Swiss watch, and a welcoming committee is already on the dock awaiting our arrival. Orientation 5:30 PM. Dinner 7 PM, on the dot. Morning coffee is at 6:30 in the AM, after which the diving starts.
