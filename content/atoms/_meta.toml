WeWork filed for bankruptcy last week. With its stock price down 99.5% since peak and whispers rampant, it'd been expected for a while.

I was wondering if it'd change anything operationally. I went in the next day and was seated close enough to the space's office managers to overhear most conversations as people made their way in throughout the day. There might've been one person who brought up the bankruptcy filing. Entirely business as usual.

Despite the bad news, every writeup on the subject has had an amazingly _optimistic_ outlook for the company. This excerpt from The Industry is representative:

> First of all, this is America, which means the rich go out different (a good thing btw, but we’ll save it for another day). “Bankrupt” doesn’t mean “gone,” exactly, but there is a hierarchy in terms of who gets screwed the most. The likeliest case is equity shareholders and stockholders get nothing, and debt holders get whatever is left. Someone could buy the company, shed the worst leases, renegiotiate the rest, and operate a leaner WeWork that benefits from stunning spaces built out using ZIRP-era VC dollars. So your nearest WeWork may shut down, but a lot of them, in some form or another, will likely stick around.

Assuming they can get that debt off the balance sheet and their most egregious leases from peak CRE renegotiated, I'd be amazed if WeWork couldn't recover. It's a great product with good revenue, and aside from those leases (which would be priced much lower in 2023), it really shouldn't cost that much to run.

Today, after years of VSCode, I finally found the options to disable its default behavior of automatically adding closing brackets and quotes (i.e. if you type `{`, it'll add `}`, or `"` to get a second `"`).

They're in Preferences (`⌘,`) under `Auto Closing Brackets` and `Auto Closing Quotes`.

I used the default for a long time because I figured that I must be missing something -- most of VSCode's defaults are pretty good, so somebody must find this behavior useful. If I give it a chance, that usefulness will eventually pop out at me.

But after a long trial period, I'm killing it with prejudice. For the life of me I can't remember one situation ever where an automatic bracket/quote saved me anything beyond the most infinitesimal amount of time, but on the other hand, especially when refactoring, they waste time by doing the wrong thing in 90%+ of cases. I'll be changing things around within an already existing line, and as I'm adding a bracket/quote, VSCode puts in a closing version even though one already exists. I actually developed muscle memory to tab right and delete the new character.

A similar story for automatically added tags in HTML templates. When writing brand new templates it's pretty handy to have the closing tags inserted for you, but I find that I'm editing existing templates the majority of the time, and once again, VSCode is constantly inserting closing tags where one already exists.

A rare miss for VSCode. Maybe I just don't get it.

An unfortunate discovery in Go today: when using `go test` and running a [testable example](https://go.dev/blog/examples), the `-count` flag is silently ignored -- a confusing, underdocumented sharp edge for users. That is unless you specified the magic number `-count=1`, in which case you get the normal test cache busting behavior.

You can find a caveat in help once you suspect the existence of this problem, but the only way to notice it's happening is that your tests are running suspiciously fast at high `-count` iterations. No error or warning is produced.

``` sh
$ go help testflag
    ...

        -count n
            Run each test, benchmark, and fuzz seed n times (default 1).
            If -cpu is set, run n times for each GOMAXPROCS value.
            Examples are always run once. -count does not apply to
            fuzz tests matched by -fuzz.
```

This makes it hard to reproduce intermittent problems in an example test. As a workaround, I'm using a shell loop that runs the test until it returns a non-zero exit code:

``` sh
while go test . -run Example_customInsertOpts -test.v -count=1; do :; done

The interfaces mixes in a private function to make it impossible for external packages to implement it. This leaves the authors free to add new functions to the interface without worrying about breaking existing user code.

A [_very_ in-depth comparison of Ruby HTTP clients in 2023](https://honeyryderchuck.gitlab.io/2023/10/15/state-of-ruby-http-clients-use-httpx.html). I try to avoid dependencies where possible, but the API of Ruby's built-in HTTP client is so absolutely brutal that I've always defaulted to using Excon.

The author finds that [HTTPX](https://github.com/HoneyryderChuck/httpx) is the best choice, which you have to take with a grain of salt since the article's author also wrote HTTPX (although the comparison is fair by my read).

HTTPX's only dependency is `http-2-next`, with no C extensions or other shenanigans. It's feature rich, and will use powerful HTTP constructs by default. See this example where multiple requests are made concurrently automatically, and those targeting the same host will multiplex over the same socket with HTTP/2:

``` ruby
HTTPX.get(
  "https://news.ycombinator.com/news",
  "https://news.ycombinator.com/news?p=2",
  "https://google.com/q=me"
) # first two requests will be multiplexed on the same socket.
```

The corner cases it can handle are genuinely impressive. For example, here's how to target a request to an IP address over HTTPS and pass a specific hostname to verify using TLS [SNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication), something that almost no one will ever have to do, but great to have for anyone who finds themselves in that position:

``` ruby
HTTPX.get("https://172.45.65.131:5647/",
  ssl: {hostname: "proxy-ssl"},
  headers: {"host": "subapp.com:5647"})

An exciting PGBouncer release: ["The one with prepared statements"](https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/releases/tag/pgbouncer_1_21_0).

Prepared statements have always been a problem for PGBouncer because they're prepared at the level of a session rather than shared in the database across connections. PGBouncer attains its multiplexing capabilities by mapping "virtual" sessions to "real" Postgres sessions, so there wouldn't be any guarantee after a statement had been prepared that a subsequent attempt to use it would go the original session.

The new version of PGBouncer solves the problem [via internal bookkeeping](https://www.pgbouncer.org/config.html#max_prepared_statements) where PGBouncer itself becomes prepared statement aware. If an incoming use of a prepared statement would go to an underlying connection where it hasn't been prepared yet, that gets taken care of first.

The release notes claim a performance improvement between 15% to 250%. I'd guess that it'd be closer to 15% for most real world apps, but if you're using PGBouncer, why not. It's still 15%.

We'll have it ready on Bridge soon. (**Update:** now available.)

Apple's being [sued in California](https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/13/airtag-lawsuit-widened-stalking-cases/) over claims that AirTags enable stalking.

This is a tough one. By designing a very functional and affordable product, Apple's created the world's best tracking device. I'm reminded of old spy movies where a hero or villain attaches a little beeping box to the undercarriage of their opponent's vehicle. These days you might just use an AirTag, with orders of magnitude improvements in range, size, and battery than what any of those old world trackers wouldn't had, and $30 instead of the $10,000 or whatever Raytheon would've charged.

It was inevitable that some of this tracking ends up being malicious, but can't any product be misused for harm? And can that really be said to be the manufacturer's responsibility?

Apple does seem to have taken significant good faith mitigation to curb misuse. Apple users are notified when an AirTag is traveling with them (I've been getting these regularly when walking around with other AirPods users), an app is available on Android to do the same, and the AirTag can be made to produce an audible tone to help identify its location. When setting one up, the owner is warned against misusing it, and is informed that Apple will happily provide information to law enforcement on request. Pre-AirTag trackers would've had none of these safety features.

Unboxed an iPhone 15 Pro Max this morning. We're well past the point of dark comedy in how little these things change year-over-year. The 15 is indistinguishable from the 14, and you have to be an Apple connoisseur to spot the differences even from a 12 or 13. You can easily tell it apart from an 11, but only because that was the year that Apple made the inspirational jump from curved edges to _square_ edges (a reboot of iPhone 4 era design). Hash tag courage.

That said, as with previous iterations, it's a great phone. Impressions from the first day of use:

* USB-C, _finally_. I now have exclusively USB-C gear, so I can travel with only one type of cable.

* The Action button is great. Instead of activating on a simple press (prone to false positives), you hold it for a moment, and it provides the perfect amount of haptic feedback. I have mine mapped to open the camera, so it's now much faster to do so (the alternative was finding a widget from the lock screen) and I can do it by touch only. The old "silent" switch it replaced was so freaking useless -- it was a crime to leave it on there for as long as they did.

Stranded in Amsterdam.

Yesterday, I was supposed to fly AMS to SFO returning from Rails World this week. I've been having pretty good luck with airlines recently, and didn't think much of it. At the gate things seems okay, except boarding is delayed a few minutes, ostensibly because the pilot is late, which in restrospect, should've been a red flag. Once we're all boarded, we're informed we'll be delayed thanks a technical issue. They're working on it and will update us at 3:30p. At 3:30p we're informed we'll get an update at 4p. At 4p, it'll be at 4:30p. At 4:30p, it'll be a 5p.

We know the writing on the wall is a cancellation, and it's a dreadful thought. This is a major leg that flies a 777. If it's cancelled, that's almost 400 people who need alternate routes. Is that even possible?

Sure enough, it's cancelled. May god have mercy on our souls.

But this is where we get some balance to our bad luck. We're informed that we've been automatically rebooked to a new flight the next day and have been given a room at the local Steigenberger near the airport, where we'll also be fed. The hotel's airport shuttle is crowded, but otherwise we exit the airport and get over there without much fanfare. This must be EU regulation working in our favor. We're flying f*ing United, so you know they would've cancelled the flight and left us on the tarmack to rot if they thought they could legally get away with it.

In a happy coincidence, Craig and I were accidentally going back on the same flight (we should've coordinated but didn't), and spend the evening exploring the local hotel airport bars.

In every North American city, the area for ten miles in every direction around an airport is an exclusion zone of highways and parking lots, as hostile to human existence as the surface of Mars. Relatively speaking the area around Amsterdam's airport is a little like this too, but only relative to the rest of Amsterdam, which is a supremely walk and bike friendly. The area around us has a lot of concrete, but also a certain amount of charm, and like the rest of the city, bike lanes in every direction. In the morning I go for a run across a short bridge and over to a sprawling park on the river called Het Amsterdamse Bos, which honestly, is nicer even than anything in central Amsterdam.

Now, sitting on a new 777, hoping our luck is better this time.

Along with `time`'s magic date of Mon Jan 2, 2006 and the `database/sql` package, some of the biggest are `html/template` and `text/template`. Runtime-checked only, nesting logic that defies explanation, necessitating custom helpers to do perform operations so basic as adding two numbers together, and some of the worst docs ever written.

I was glad to discover that someone's trying to write an alternative: [Templ](https://templ.guide/). It produces a hierarchy of nested partial views similar to React apps, and generates Go code in a way reminiscent of sqlc.

I tried it on a toy project and got to something workable quickly. Templ's fairly new and has rough edges:

* No line numbers in case of problems, making debugging difficult.

* No equivalent to Gofmt for `*.templ` files, so you're back micromanaging whitespace and manually fixing imports.

* Lots of regenerating code on changes. [There's a subcommand](https://templ.guide/commands-and-tools/hot-reload) that'll watch the disk, regenerate, and restart a command, but your success in integrating with this will vary wildly.

I recently switched this site back over to use a [custom built ImageMagick binary](https://github.com/brandur/sorg/commit/65eadb02e037aeb7e29e7658f1ad5c3c04ce7a82). I had to move off of it a while back after the binary I built started producing this perplexing error:

```
$ /home/runner/imagemagick/bin/magick identify -list format
/home/runner/imagemagick/bin/magick: symbol lookup error: /home/runner/imagemagick/bin/magick: undefined symbol: heif_deinit
```

I'd prefer to be using ImageMagick's mainline release of course, but for reasons I don't completely understand, there's a broad refusal to include HEIC support out of the box, thus the custom build.

The error above is impressively bad, but through brute force trial and error, I was eventually able to track it down to the use of an outdated `libheif-dev`. `libheif-dev`'s a package that wasn't traditionally included in default APT sources, so I'd been getting it from the third party `strukturag` repository. Removing the third party repository sourced a newer version of `libheif-dev` and fixed the problem.

What's a little mystifying is how hard all of this is, still. A HEIC-friendly ImageMagick is hard to come by, and googling these problems uncovers little. But HEIC's a common format that's been in use for years on about half the world's smartphones, and by extension, about half the world's cameras. You'd think that by now that there'd be more demand for working with this extremely common image format.

My off the cusp hypothesis is that the fact that there isn't goes to show just how few people are building anything on their own these days. All the popular social and photography platforms handle HEIC transparently for you to the point where probably 99.9+% of its users have no idea they're even using it. Probably inevitable, but not a hopeful sign for a less consolidated future.

A post from [Google's security](https://security.googleblog.com/2023/06/learnings-from-kctf-vrps-42-linux.html) describes how in the year leading up to June 2023 60% of reported vulnerabilities were in `io_uring`, and Google's paid out **$1 million USD** for `io_uring` exploits.

Due to high risk of compromise, Google's turned it off in their properties:

Farina and I successfully summitted Mt Whitney last week. It's the highest peak in the lower 48, so although it felt great getting to the top, the air up there was sure thin.

Getting up and down in one day is a slog involving early morning headlamps, so we turned it into a more leisurely backpacking trip starting out of Horseshoe Meadow, a day to Rock Creek, a day to Guitar Lake, and then a day up and down Whitney and out the normal way to Whitney Portal.

The biggest thing that comes to mind is on-call. Back at iStock in 2011 our ops guys made all hours trips to the datacenters with depressing regularity, so while it made self-hosting possible, the cost was much higher than just the hardware bill. But that was a long time ago, and a lot of it was probably self-inflicted, so maybe things are easier nowadays.

The next thing that comes to mind is blob storage (e.g. S3). It's such a useful abstraction, and although open-source alternatives exist, it's a lot. Would even a company hardened in their intention to self-host turn their back on it? I would guess not.

```

Unlike a more traditional ORM, sqlc can't arbitrarily chain expressions. All the SQL that can be in the SQL is in the SQL, which means that any logical branching has to be done with `CASE`/`WHEN` expressions.

This monstrosity has a straightforward objective: listing, with pagination. But it does allow pagination along two dimensions (`id` and `name`), and with a cursor or without, which is where it gets a little gnarly.

That said, compared to pagination logic whose parts to build a complete query are littered across a half-dozen pagination utility modules, and whose totality is obscured by its piecemeal nature, maybe the sqlc version isn't so bad?

[On GitHub's HQ, their infamous Oval Office, and the battle over its rug](https://archive.is/JrY5l). The 2010s were a neat time in San Francisco, with many of the most important products in the world being developed a few blocks from each other, and new offices were coming online one after another, each more extravagant than the last.

> A little over a month after the new office opened, one of GitHub’s employees opened an internal discussion thread. A feminist hacker space had launched a crowdfunding campaign with a satirical perk, priced at $50,000: a “Meritocracy is a Joke” rug, custom-designed “for your company’s oval office [sic], to show you don’t support the myth of meritocracy (one of the tech industry’s most prevalent excuses for women and minorities being marginalized).” Given that some people were clearly offended by the word “meritocracy,” asked the original poster, should we be using the term?

A broad lesson on how much easier it is to destroy than it is to create.

Today, that rug is gone, that office is gone, all comparable offices in SF are gone, as is the essential will of the industry to be proud of its values and what it's creating. Something as quirky as GitHub 3.0 could never be built in the present.

> Defending the rug could have been a teaching moment, an opportunity to show why it is important to declare that anyone can do what they put their minds to, even if it isn’t always perfectly executed. It was a small moment, but conceding this point paved the way for more people to tug angrily at tech’s monuments in the years that followed—to which tech willingly folded, each time. Tech needs to find the courage again to embrace its values, which could command more respect from its critics than simply apologizing. If tech can look past the totalizing shame it currently feels, it can more honestly evaluate both its accomplishments and its shortcomings, and find a way to weave them together into a memorable public legacy.

Would love to see it.

Today I discovered the power of Postgres' `DISTINCT ON` syntax, a useful feature that did exactly what I wanted it to with my first try.

Everyone knows the common `distinct` function (e.g. `SELECT distinct(name)`), which gets all unique values for a given field.

`DISTINCT ON` is similar, but it groups rows by a distinct field, and then returns whatever you want from one of them based on an `ORDER BY` clause.

Example: we have _saved_ queries that have one or more query _runs_ each. Return the latest query run (`finished_at DESC`) that either failed or succeeded for each saved query:

``` go
-- name: QueryGetFailedOrSucceededBySavedQueryIDMany :many
SELECT DISTINCT ON (saved_query_id) *
FROM query_run
WHERE status = 'failed' OR status = 'succeeded'
    AND saved_query_id = any(@saved_query_id::uuid[])
ORDER BY saved_query_id, finished_at DESC;
```

Easy to use and concise.

A piece from LWN on [the early days of Linux](https://lwn.net/Articles/928581/) at the University of Helsinki.

On Linus taking down the university's fragile Sun machines:

> At some point, Linux gained support for Ethernet and TCP/IP. That meant one could read Usenet without having to use a modem. Alas, early Linux networking code was occasionally a little rough, having been written from scratch. At one point, Linux would send some broken packets that took down all of the Sun machines on the network. As it was difficult to get the Sun kernel fixed, Linux was banned from the university network until its bug was fixed. Not having Usenet access from one's desk is a great motivator.

On the version 1.0 release event (complete with press) in _1994_:

> In the spring of 1994 we felt that Linux was done. Finished. Nothing more to add. One could use Linux to compile itself, to read Usenet, and run many copies of the xeyes program at once. We decided to release version 1.0 and arranged a release event. The Finnish computer press was invited, and a TV station even sent a crew. Most of the event consisted of ceremonially compiling Linux 1.0 in the background, while Linus and others spoke about what Linux was and what it was good for. Linus explained that commercial Unix for a PC was so expensive that it was easier to write your own.

And [it was recorded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaDpjlFpbfo), complete with a young, handsome university student version of Linus.

I miss the old internet. What's available today is infinitely more powerful compared to what we had back then, but in many ways, so much worse. In the old days people built sites on subjects they were passionate about, and doing so was its own reward -- this was before the web became monetized, and _long_ before the pursuit of social media clout. There was no Squarespace, so people did their own design and coding, even if they weren't technologists. You might've been hosting on Geocities, but it was also common to be running a web server on the computer under your desk.

Today, 95% of the internet has converged on the same bland big-fonts-in-center-column-with-lots-of-whitespace design (of which this site is guilty), and slathered with paywalls, cookie selectors, login modals, toast notifications, trackers, and so many other dark patterns that they're hard to keep track of. And that's the _good_ news. The bad is that most people are skipping the website completely and retreating into the walled gardens of Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, or Twitter.

And at long last, finished redesigning the main articles pages themselves, [for example](/sqlc).

I've been intending to do this for at least two years, and for once am glad that I procrastinated on it.

A few years ago I wrote [Tweeting for 10,000 years](/10000-years), a thought experiment in how to improve the longevity of software, which is infamously prone to breakage by way of bugs or changes in its underlying infrastructure. It explores ideas like choosing platforms likely to be long-lived, stable languages, minimizing dependencies, and deploying self-contained binaries.

In it I list two of the top risk factors for its eventual demise as:

> * Changes in **Twitter’s API** could spell the end. This would take the form of a backwards-incompatible change like a new required parameter, change in the structure of responses, or adjustment to how applications authenticate.
>
> * Relatedly, changes in **Twitter’s product* are also dangerous. They could move to a new pricing model, remodel the product’s core design, or fold as a company.

Well, if it'd made it 10,000 years you probably wouldn't be reading this. Today I got this email:

The experiment's final longevity was 4 years, 8 months. Not half bad, but a little short of the stated goal.

Today I learned that Rack servers like Puma can run an operation after a request has been completed with [`rack.after_reply`](https://github.blog/2022-04-11-performance-at-github-deferring-stats-with-rack-after_reply/). There's been various ways to accomplish this since the early 2010s, but I hadn't realized that it'd become standardized.

This can be a great way to offload more expensive operations like network calls out-of-band from user requests to improve latency (even if incompatible with use of request-level transactions). In the linked GitHub describes using `rack.after_reply` for emitting statistics, and they'd previously used a similar technique to perform Ruby garbage collection between requests, although later [stopped doing that](https://github.blog/2018-05-18-removing-oobgc/).

At Stripe we did something similar to make generating "events" (for use in sending webhooks) out-of-band. Generating events involved rendering API resources, which was expensive, making generating events also expensive, so taking them out-of-band shaved somewhere in the neighborhood of 10-100 ms in latency (can't remember the exact numbers) off some of our most critical API paths.

Here's me evangelizing the idea of an [ephemeral database](/fragments/ephemeral-db) one more time.

When we first put ours in, I wasn't totally convinced that it was the right decision. Keeping high volume data out of the core path seemed like a good idea in a conceptual sense, but another migration line and another database to look after would make development and operations harder.

Months later, I'm _certain_ it was the right decision. Our core database (accounts, clusters, subscriptions, billing, audit log, etc.) is stable at less than 1 GB of data, while the ephemeral DB has ballooned to 300 GB by virtue of the kind of raw, voluminous data it holds (metrics). Having the two operationally independent in case of a major catastrophe helps me sleep better at night. If our ephemeral DB were to go hard down, metrics pages wouldn't load, but everything else would work just fine. Maintaining a separate migration line for the ephemeral DB is mildly annoying, but that annoyance is _so_ mild that I've stopped noticing. A single `make` target bootstraps both databases for development/testing, and 95%+ of database changes happen on the main line.

Software engineering is tradeoffs abound. But I'm giving ephemeral DB the platinum award of computation -- major benefits, and with downside so miniscule that it's hardly noticed.

Okta is considered to be the gold standard in the identity management front, the sleek Silicon Valley entrant to a market of long-toothed competitors.

I was looking into building an Okta integration for inclusion in the Okta Integration Network (OIN), and something that I found incredibly surprising is how manual the whole process it. Intuitively, I would've thought that an Okta admin would browse the catalog, install an app, and be automatically granted access to its features as machines cooperated behind the scenes to make it happen.

Here's how it actually works: an Okta admin browses the catalog, installs an app, rummages around in Okta dashboards extracting a set of URLs, IDs, and secrets, then manually transmits them to the app owner to facilitate integration. [CloudFlare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/identity/idp-integration/okta/) provides an Okta-specific Dashboard to enter them. [Brex](https://www.brex.com/support/how-do-i-enable-openid-connect-oidc-sso) will send you an email where you copy them in. Others suggest visiting their sites and opening a support ticket with the magic values.

I thought I (and all of them) must be missing something, but I don't think so. Here's [Okta developer support](https://devforum.okta.com/t/oidc-authorize-url-for-isvs-oin-apps/13064) confirming this is how it's done.

Does this seem, like, crazy, to anybody else? Of course there's still going to be some manual inputs on the web, but for this to be the normal process for most preeminent IDM on the internet? Again, surprising.

A few weeks ago [Tailscale announced they'd be allowing anyone to bring their own OIDC provider](https://tailscale.com/blog/custom-oidc/). My first reaction to this was that it seemed like overkill more likely than not to create unforeseen problems. But after looking into Okta, my new train of thought is that if we were to build that, we'd not only provide the openness of OIDC standard, but it could act alternatively as our Okta onboarding portal for free.

  description = """\
A few weeks back I'd mentioned in passing that [we'd migrated off Keycloak](/fragments/password-hashing).

I got a question about why, so I'm putting down some rationale here. I respect open-source projects a lot, so this isn't meant to throw shade on Keycloak in any way, but I believe in being transparent about these things so people can read alternative arguments and make better-informed tech decisions.

A few reasons why we moved away from Keycloak:

* It has an API for integration, but its API reference offers precious little beyond the names of API resources and fields. There was never enough documentation to integrate a new feature, always necessitating trial and error.

* Core authentication-related flows were the most likely to regress because writing tests against a remote API requires a lot of stubbing. With heavy stubbing involved, you really only end up writing tests that verify that your stubs are set up the way you expected them to be, and that made it very easy to break things because mistakes would not be caught by CI.

* Keycloak pages like login or email verification are customized using a template language that was divergent from our main Frontend stack, and which no one was every particularly excited to write. They'd languish without updates and look awful compared to the rest of the site. This is also why some features were slow to happen, like multi-factor support, which we'll finally be shipping next week.

* Operationally, it was a black box wherein if something went wrong, no one knew how to fix it. We had a very near miss where a Heroku regression was crashing Keycloak on start up with an [inscrutable backtrace](https://github.com/mieckert/keycloak-heroku/issues/4), and which luckily manifested in our staging environment first, but which we knew was coming for prod on the next 24 hour dyno cycle. None of the people who'd chosen and integrated Keycloak had even the faintest idea how to diagnose the problem or fix it. In the end we were able to debug it by digging deeply in Keycloak source code, but were within hours of our login system being hard down with no fix in sight.

* I wasn't super confident of its security bonafides given the glimpses into its internals I'd seen. For example, it defaults to PBFKD2 for password hashing at 27,500 iterations, far below the 2023 recommendation [from OWASP](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#pbkdf2) of 600,000 iterations. I admit to having only this one example and maybe everything else is above bar, but who knows.

* It's a huge Java app and not that cheap to run. It needed a performance dyno on Heroku due to high memory requirements, and between that and a database in staging and prod it was $800/month, or about half our total bill.

I'm usually against the NIH mindset, but sometimes it's right. Looking up best practices for storing passwords is easier than looking up how Keycloak does it, the answer to which isn't documented and only exists in Discourse forums or by reading source code. Integrating SSO isn't that hard anymore thanks the widespread standardization around [OIDC](https://openid.net/connect/). Implementing flows for email verifications and password resets is a little more work, but you end up having to do most of it under Keycloak anyway if you want a custom theme.

GitHub Actions don't allow steps to be extract and moduralized in any way, so with many jobs in the workflow, the `actions/setup-go` step needs to be duplicated many times over. Defining `GO_VERSION` meant that when upgrading to a new version of Go, we only had to change one value in the file.

But it still wasn't optimal because when upgrading to a new version of Go, we'd have to change the version in `go.mod` (twice actually, because we're on Heroku and Heroku's dumb `+heroku goVersion 1.20` magic comment is mandatory), and then _also_ in every GitHub Actions workflow `.yaml` file. It's easy to forget one and break something.

There's an easy solution. It turns out that `actions/setup-go` supports a `go-version-file` directive that reads a version out of a `go.mod` file:

``` yaml
steps:
  - name: Install Go
    uses: actions/setup-go@v3
    with:
      cache: true
      check-latest: true
      go-version-file: "go.mod"
```

Now when we upgrade to a new Go, only one file is changed.

From Amazon Route 53: [Workload isolation using shuffle sharding](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/workload-isolation-using-shuffle-sharding/).

In short, Route 53 domains are sharded by so they map to one of 2,048 virtual servers. The sharding process means that some domains share servers with other domains, and under a normal sharding algorithm, domains would share all their servers with those same domains on their shard. This isn't great because if I'm an unlucky customer on the same shard as github.com who's getting DDOSed all the time, if their shards are taken down that means I'm down too. "Shuffle sharding" defines sharding such that even if I share servers with github.com, some of the servers I map to are "shuffled" so that I'm also guaranteed to _not_ share some with github.com. Even if every server hosting github.com goes down, some of mine are still up.

The latest in the accidental culture war: [Twitter is sunsetting SMS as a 2FA method](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2023/an-update-on-two-factor-authentication-using-sms-on-twitter).

As usual, the I-hate-whoever-WaPo-tells-me-to crowd immediately lost their minds, flying into spectacular fits of performative outrage, dramatically falling to the ground and beating their tiny fists against the floor wailing about Elon compromising security for society's most vulnerable, like the downtrodden legacy blue-check elite, whose refusal to pay $8 puts them on moral parity with the conscientious objectors who fled north to dodge their draft for the Vietnam War.

For anyone who doesn't follow this closely, SMS isn't just the worst way to do second factor auth, it's the worst _by far_:

1. Being monopolies that don't actually have to be good at what they do, the security posture of telcos is total garbage, and [simjacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam) isn't just common, it's terrifyingly common. The Twitter account of @Jack himself was taken over by this method as recently as 2019.
2. Lapsed phone numbers get reused, and new subscribers can often pick from a pool. Fish in a barrel.
3. UX-wise, SMS deliverability sucks, especially in countries without modern infrastructure, and especially in our age of ubiquitous SMS spam.
4. Sending SMS is expensive. So not only do you get reduced security, but you get to pay extra for the privilege.

If you're a user, you shouldn't use it. If you're a provider, you shouldn't provide it.

Sure, Musk's motivation for retiring it is probably mostly (4), but that doesn't make it a bad idea. Sure, it's weird that Twitter Blue users can still use it, but that's Twitter saying, "if you pay money, you have a license to do whatever you want, even opt into reduced security (at your own risk)". You also have to think that paying users are < 1% of the platform, so their continued option to use SMS has negligble effect on the whole.

One more note on password migrations: damn it, we did find one bug. Luckily, an internal user ran into it early and it was never experienced publicly.

We run our Postgres service on Postgres, and develop like we prescribe others to, with a core tenet being data consistency. I'd added these `CHECK` constraints:

``` sql
ALTER TABLE account
    ADD CONSTRAINT pbkdf2_not_null_check CHECK (
        (algorithm <> 'argon2id-pbkdf2-sha256' AND algorithm <> 'pbkdf2-sha256')
        OR ((algorithm = 'argon2id-pbkdf2-sha256' OR algorithm = 'pbkdf2-sha256')
            AND (pbkdf2_hash_iterations IS NOT NULL))
    );
ALTER TABLE account
    ADD CONSTRAINT pbkdf2_null_check CHECK (
        (algorithm = 'argon2id-pbkdf2-sha256' OR algorithm = 'pbkdf2-sha256')
        OR ((algorithm <> 'argon2id-pbkdf2-sha256' AND algorithm <> 'pbkdf2-sha256')
            AND (pbkdf2_hash_iterations IS NULL))
    );
```

They're a little awkward to read, but the first guarantees we have a value for PBKDF2 hash iterations where the password involves PBKDF2. The second guarantees we _don't_ value a value where it doesn't.

There was a case in the password reset flow where we'd upgrade a newly reset password to Argon2id, but if the old password was PBKDF2, forgot to empty its PBKDF2 hash iterations. The `CHECK` constraint failed along with the password reset.

We got a fix out quickly, but there's an argument to be made that it wasn't worth breaking a critical path (even temporarily) for data consistency.

The cost/benefit of this case is close enough that I might agree, but would still form a counterargument. A 500 is bad, but when this sort of thing would happen at Stripe (on Mongo, no `CHECK`s), instead of some 500s you'd end up with a pile of inconsistent data written that someone would have to manually repair afterwards. A small error that was in production for only a minute or two would lead to a multi-week cleanup effort, with many a bespoke migration and outbound email written.

When `CHECK`s (or FKs, data type validations, etc.) fail, no tainted state makes its way to the database. There's user impact until the problem is fixed, but no impact afterwards. Also, even if a user request succeeds in the non-`CHECK` alternative with inconsistent data written, it doesn't mean that things are actually _right_, and often leads users having to find out for themselves that something's broken thanks to the inconsistencies.

We'll probably keep doing the `CHECK`s.

Follow up from yesterday's write up on [password hash migration](/fragments/password-hash-nesting). We're fully migrated:

``` sql

 argon2id
 argon2id-pbkdf2-sha256
```

(Notice: No vanilla `pbkdf2-sha256` left. `(null)` is for password-less SSO-based accounts.)

I captured a backup beforehand just in case, but otherwise went for a pretty aggressive migration strategy of ovewriting hashes without intermediary fields or other major hedges. It went smoothly. Here's a log line showing a hash upgrade to Argon2id-only, implying the user was able to sucessfully login via the nested hashing scheme:

```
password_hash_upgrade_line: Upgraded from "argon2id-pbkdf2-sha256" to "argon2id"
    [account: 03c97908-32a3-445b-a52e-03aa9fdec5f8] [hash time: 0.024923s]
```

Some guards I put in:

* Wrote tests for the migration. 95% of programmers have the attitude that tests are for code, but they're unneeded for migrations, even complex ones. IMO, scary.
* Wrote the critical section of code to hash the hash in triplicate. Once to do the work, once to check the work from tests, and again in the migrator to hash again to check its own work. Writing it manually three times reduced the likelihood of me accidentally flipping the hash or parameter order by accident.
* Rolled the migrator out with a dry run flag, prompting it to do everything it'd normally do in a complete run, but then roll back the transaction afterwards, producing useful logging we can verify, but discarding results. (We use this transactional dry run trick a lot.)
* Used a compiled language with explicit, static types so my code is helping prevent bugs instead of creating them (*cough* Ruby).
* Manually tested the migration of my own passwords in a production-like-but-not-production environment before rolling out to prod.

This site uses AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for automated TLS certificate managment, and I got a request via email today to approve a renewal through 2024. Validating ownership of a domain can either happen via email or by a `CNAME` record installed to its DNS, and all those years ago when I first set this up I apparently chose email and have been manually approving a renewal every year since.

Validation by `CNAME` is better because it's fully automatic. As long as ACM sees that the `CNAME` is still installed, it can validate ownership of the domain without asking the user about it. So today, after many years of procrastination, I finally went into ACM to generate a new cert validated by `CNAME` instead of email.

While doing so, I noticed that as of mid-2021, ACM supports non-RSA certificates using ECDSA elliptic curves, which I opted into. They're widely supported, and superior to RSA in every respect that matters: less computationally expensive to verify, shorter keys that mean reduced network traffic, and superior cryptography that was developed more in the open compared to RSA.

But as complete of a product as AWS is, sometimes it has some fairly mistifying edges. I was given the choice between the P256 and P384 curves, opted for P384, but then found that I couldn't select my new certificate over in CloudFront (AWS' CDN). Upon further reading I found [CloudFront only supports P256](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/07/amazon-cloudfront-now-supports-ecdsa-certificates-for-https-connections-to-viewers/).

An [HN discussion on unlimited PTO](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34340246).

We ran under unlimited PTO at Heroku the whole time I was there. At Stripe we started with unlimited PTO before moving to fixed. Stripe's PTO allowance wasn't generous, but it worked out okay in the end as I'd had some built up when I left which they ended up having to pay out.

A lot of commenters are so cynical that they view unlimited PTO policies as ill-intentioned, designed to avoid a PTO payout like mine. Maybe that's the case for some companies, but in the ones I worked for, it was good-intentioned with suboptimal outcomes.

You might intuit that the problem with unlimited PTO would be that it'd get abused, and I'm sure that's happened, but in my experience, the types of people who'd abuse such a system don't tend to be hired at the types of companies that'd offer it. I'm entirely sure that unlimited PTO worked _against_ me the entire time I was under it, and the same was true for most of my colleagues. It wasn't entirely the fault of the policy. To succeed under such a system, you really need to be looking out for number one it, tracking your own vacation target carefully, and championing for yourself.

But of course it's difficult, especially when you see your colleagues working so hard, which makes you feel bad about taking time off. And unless you've got a vocally pro-vacation manager, which is unlikely, you always have to wonder what they think about someone taking more than average.

A lot of companies have moved back in the direction of fixed PTO, which is probably for the best. Years ago [Travis CI implemented a _minimum_ vacation policy](https://www.paperplanes.de/2014/12/10/from-open-to-minimum-vacation-policy.html) which is an idea I liked, but things didn't turn out so well for that company, and I haven't heard of much about minimum PTO since.

See: [PEP 703 – Making the Global Interpreter Lock Optional in CPython](https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/).

Fascinating stuff, and the detail and attention that goes into these PEPs is just incredible. The GIL (global interpreter lock) has been the age-old Achilles Heels of Python and Ruby, and given the advanced age of these languages, I'd assumed they were problems that weren't going to be solved as an increasingly intricate implementation makes more fundamental changes harder to tackle every year. But an increasingly parallel world of computing seems to have created demand to attract people with the necessary gumption to pull this off.

Ruby gave up on the GIL in favor of [Ractors](/nanoglyphs/018-ractors) which suggest the use of many parallel environments, each with their own GIL. They might've worked, but were _extremely_ backward incompatible, and two years later, nothing supports them.

Python's optional GIL will be opt-in via compiler flag, but provides a path for the ecosystem to migrate incrementally so it could be default in a not-so-distant future.

A couple things that stood out to me. The implementation will move to a stop-the-world GC to freeze necssary state:

> When running without the GIL, the implementation needs a way to ensure that reference counts remain stable during cycle detection. Threads running Python code must be paused to ensure that references and reference counts remain stable. Once the cycles are identified, other threads are resumed.

And because the GC becomes stop-the-world, its generational GC is disabled:

> The existing Python garbage collector uses three generations. When compiling without the GIL, the garbage collector will only use a single generation (i.e., non-generational). The primary reason for this change is to reduce the impact of the stop-the-world pauses in multithreaded applications.

Single-threaded performance takes a 10% hit, but there's already suggestions for changes to recoup some of that. Over time most of that likely gets optimized away.

Network effects in cities are powerful, and that indeed has been the story of SF and the Bay Area writ large over the decade as companies swooped in soak up innovative energy, capital, and talent, which further compounded and cascaded. My prediction today is the city will continue to observe a _reverse_ network effect as more companies give up expensive leases which have continually lessening ROI.

Posted today: [_Stripe Sets One-Year Timetable to Decide on Going Public_](https://archive.ph/GqSBm). Along with this classic Stripe press "leak", the company also sent a simultaneously email to alumni, which honestly, was nice of them.

Predictably, there was a lot of carthasis from ex-employees, with even more chatter than during the 14% layoff a few months ago, and a hundredfold above ambient Slack levels. With the first batch of RSUs set to expire early 2024, there'd been a lot of consternation over the last couple years to say the least, so it was a big event.

It's unambiguously a good thing, but I couldn't help but notice that even with this BEST NEWS EVER message, the company is still tacking into its usual non-commitalism. Instead of unambiguously planning an IPO, it's "either an IPO or private market transaction", leaving huge error bars and uncertainty.

Is this a food picture blog now? I hope not. I'll try not to make a habit of it.

My curiosity was piqued when I found out there's a Mensho subsidary in the ground floor of the Twitter building. Mensho's a ramen company out of Japan that opened a shop called Mensho Tokyo a few years ago in San Francisco, notable for having the best ramen on this continent, and an omnipresent 50+ person lineup out the door and down the street, something I thought would clear with time, but never did. In 2021, they expanded into Twitter's ground floor with a new installment -- Jikasei Mensho.

Unlike the original, Jikasei Mensho's more of a fast lunch stop sort of deal, and as far as I can tell, not great? You walk up to a counter, order from a computer McDonald's-style, and your minimum tip option is 15% on a $22 bowl of fast food. It arrives in a plastic bowl. The chashu was good, the eggs were good, but the noodles and broth subpar, and some of furnishings questionable, like sliced lemons. Maybe I happened across it on an off day, or maybe ramen tastes worse out of plastic.

Post-Elon return-to-office Twitter is a bit more lively. There were quite a few people down in the cafeteria area where Jikasei Mensho is, where only a few months ago it all sat empty.

Witnessed a laptop snatching this morning. Woman is sitting next to window in a crowded cafe. Thief comes crashing in, grabs woman's computer, and bolts. Five people run out after him, but as with a lot of criminal activity in San Francisco these days, it was organized, and a getaway car was waiting at the corner. Thief slams car door shut and rides off into the sunset (not literally; this was 11 AM).

It sounds blasé described post-hoc, but even "just" a theft with nobody hurt (luckily, it could easily have gone the other way) is hectic in real time. Downshifted mentally at the time in computing mode, it took a good ten seconds to process what'd even happened. People yelling. Tables knocked over. Coffee cups in pieces on the floor.

Whenever something like this comes up, San Francisco apologists are quick to make platitudinal statements like "report it to the police", as if this is some kind of deep insight that only an enlightened California pro(re)gressive could have imagined. The situation was a _perfect_ microcosm for why most people have stopped bothering. The SFPD was called immediately, and I waited around an hour without a single officer showing up, despite being within six blocks of a station, a cruiser rolling by every few minutes, and a situation that easily could've ended with someone seriously hurt. The crime had dozens of witnesses and clear HD footage from two separate cameras, but even if the PD did eventually appear, no one will be caught, let alone see a day in prison.

I started chatting with the guy next to me, who having just moved to the city a week previous was somewhat surprised. (But not _that_ surprised, having gotten an accurate taste of the city's culture from various viral videos.)

I told him that this wasn't unknown, but not common. San Francisco, intent to preserve its reputation as deteriorating municipal hell stemming from the worst mismanagement of wealth in a thousand years, made sure to prove me wrong. Five minutes later, a woman walks in, grabs a handful of bills from the tip jar, and before anyone can react, leisurely strolls back out.

I finally finished _God of War Ragnarök_ this weekend. It's a great game, with creative interpretations of Thor and Odin that turned out very well. Thor's a lumbering giant who's highly able, even if overly loyal to his father. Odin's got mob boss vibes, which is unconventional, but a gamble that paid off. The game is _huge_, and I was surprised multiple times thinking I'd gotten to the end only to find a whole new world to explore.

I 100%'ed it unlike the 2018 _God of War_, which meant that I wasted a ton of time following YouTube guides to find artifacts and ravens. I downgraded the difficulty to "give me grace" for the last two optional bosses and don't feel bad about it. They spam attacks like no tomorrow, have a criminal number of unblockables, and the target lock system kind of sucks, especially in multi-enemy fights.

It's notable that although very good, for all intents and purposes it's the same game as the one released in 2018. There's new story and new areas (although with some reuse), but the game engine, game mechanics, upgrades/skills system, and combat are all practically identical. Development for 2018's started in 2014, which means that back then it took five years to build a full game and whole new engine, wherein Ragnarok was six for a game plus some minor updates. I'm sure some of that was lockdown delay, but I kind of suspect the game industry is hitting a plateau for large projects in the same way NASA did for space missions, Lockheed Martin for fighter jets, or Oracle for databases. _Horizon Forbidden West_ (another triple-A title) was the same -- great game, but practically indistinguishable from the original.

I've been writing Go professionally for something like a year and a half now, and compared to my previous daily driver Ruby, almost everything is better. Readability, speed of runtime, speed of tests, speed of refactoring, IDE insight, tooling -- I could go on all day.

But when building out a larger-scale app with a non-trivial amount of domain logic and objects, it's got holes. Some are as wide as Jupiter, and I can't believe how little I see about them online.

The biggest I'm looking for an answer to is data loading, or more specifically, how to do data loading without thousands of lines of extraneous boilerplate. We solved our SQL-in-Go problem by moving to [sqlc](/sqlc), but that in itself isn't enough. I still write code like this daily:

``` go
team, err := queries.TeamGetByID(ctx, uuid.UUID(req.TeamID))
if err != nil {
    return nil, xerrors.Errorf("error getting team: %w", err)
}

if team.OrganizationID.Valid {
    org, err := queries.OrganizationGetByID(ctx, team.OrganizationID.UUID)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, xerrors.Errorf("error getting organization: %w", err)
    }

    if org.MarketplaceID.Valid {
        marketplace, err := queries.MarketplaceGetByID(ctx, org.MarketplaceID.UUID)
        if err != nil {
            return nil, xerrors.Errorf("error getting marketplace: %w", err)
        }

        return nil, apierror.NewBadRequestErrorf(ctx,
            errMessageTeamDeleteMarketplace, marketplace.DisplayName)
    }
}
```

In Ruby (or any language with some dynamicism and a good ORM), that whole block compacts comfortably to a single line of code:

``` ruby
raise ... if Team[req.team_id].organization.marketplace
```

And the Go version is only as short of it is because our foreign keys mean that we can skip handling some types of user-facing errors. i.e. We don't have to worry about translating a missing organization to a 404 because foreign keys guarantee its existence. Sqlc also saves hundreds of lines -- before the Go code for every one of those queries like `TeamGetByID` had to be written by a human and tested. Now we write the SQL and let sqlc do the work, but using Go built-ins `database/sql` you still get to do all of it.

Another bad-but-unavoidable Go pattern is preloading objects to avoid N + 1 queries, but then having to manually map them into structures that your code can actually use:

``` go
teams, err := queries.TeamGetByIDMany(ctx, sliceutil.Map(unsentInvoices,
    func(i dbsqlc.Invoice) uuid.UUID { return i.TeamID }))
if err != nil {
    return xerrors.Errorf("error getting teams: %w", err)
}

teamsMap := sliceutil.KeyBy(teams,
    func(t dbsqlc.Team) uuid.UUID { return t.ID })
```

Again, with an ORM this is:

``` ruby
Invoice.load(..., eager: [:team]).each { |i| i.team.name }
```

And the Go code was >2x longer just _one release of Go ago_. Notice the functions `sliceutil.Map` and `sliceutil.KeyBy` which were impossible without generics. Before, these were an initialization and a `for` loop -- 4-5 lines each.

I've experimented with custom data loading frameworks that sit a layer above sqlc to reduce boilerplate:

``` go
err = dbload.New(tx).
    Add(dbload.Loader(&loadBundle.Cluster, req.ClusterID)).
    Add(dbload.LoaderCustomID(&loadBundle.Provider,
       req.ProviderID)).
    Add(dbload.LoaderCustomID(&loadBundle.Plan,
        dbsqlc.ProviderAndPlan(req.ProviderID, req.PlanID))).
    Add(dbload.LoaderCustomID(&loadBundle.Region,
        dbsqlc.ProviderAndRegion(req.ProviderID, req.RegionID))).

    // must be loaded after cluster
    Add(dbload.LoaderFunc(&loadBundle.PostgresVersion, func() *uuid.UUID {
        return &loadBundle.Cluster.PostgresVersionID
    })).
    Add(dbload.LoaderFunc(&loadBundle.Team, func() *uuid.UUID {
        return &loadBundle.Cluster.TeamID
    })).
    Load(ctx)
if err != nil {
    return nil, err
}
```

But so far it's nowhere near enough -- this one makes point loading by IDs a lot more succinct, but doesn't handle anything less trivial like associated objects or one-to-many relationships.

I'm fairly sure that there's nothing approaching an answer to this problem in the Go ecosystem. But aren't there millions of lines of production Go out there by now? How aren't more people running into this?

An article from [37 Signals on cloud spend](https://dev.37signals.com/our-cloud-spend-in-2022/).

They're concerned enough about their AWS spend that they're moving to their own hardware, a path paved before them by the likes of Dropbox and GitHub. It's also always interesting when companies are transparent about their cloud spend. Hey (their email service) for example, costs $89k/month or $1.1M/year in AWS, with the biggest component being RDS, which eats a quarter of that.

The AWS bill is a creeping concern that tends to trend slowly upward over time without anyone really noticing, then suddenly jumps out of a bush to knife you in jugular. It in the beginning it's "wow, look at all this stuff we're getting for a few bucks a month". Then a few years later it's "what?! how many f* millions?? holy shit!!" It's amazing how much money can be spent at $0.023 a gigabyte. At Heroku and Stripe we were eventually forced to engage in major AWS cost reduction projects, and in both cases the engineers involved ended up paying their own salaries many times over.

I'm reminded of Christopher Nolan's _Interstellar_, in which he makes an effort to keep the movie relatively grounded, famously bringing on physicists as consultants, and even using contemporary shuttles and rockets in some parts. But even this "grounded" movie necessitates the sudden appearance of a nearby wormhole, and the invention of anti-gravity technology for the plot to work.

As cool as SpaceX is, it's not even one percent of one percent of what humanity needs to colonize another planet, and appears to be right up against the envelope in terms of scale we're able to tackle.

In the off chance this helps someone else: I started building [my own ImageMagick](https://github.com/brandur/imagemagick-builder) after the project changed their static binary to an AppImage, which doesn't work very well.

As with all programs from that age, every feature is configurable, and it's non-trivial to get it compiled with support for more unusual formats like HEIC. I thought I'd succeeded, but have for months been using a build that couldn't read HEIC, and it'd only been working by virtue of me not uploading a HEIC in a while.

My `./configure` invocation looked right:

``` sh
./configure --with-heic=yes --with-webp=yes ...
```

But it'd been silently failing:

```
Delegate Library Configuration:
  ...
  Ghostscript lib   --with-gslib=no	 no
  Graphviz          --with-gvc=yes	 no
  HEIC              --with-heic=yes  no
  ...
```

Yes to HEIC, but actually ... `no`.

There's [GitHub issues around](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/1470) with the same problem. It can have a variety of causes, but probably means that configure couldn't load one of the dependencies for HEIC properly (`libde265` and `libheif`).

ImageMagick's build process silently swallows problems, so it's necessary to go to `configure.log` to find out what happened. Digging into mine, I found that I was missing another dependency called `dav1d`, which turns out to be an AV1 decoder from the VideoLAN project.

```
configure:31871: $PKG_CONFIG --exists --print-errors "libheif >= 1.4.0"
Package dav1d was not found in the pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing `dav1d.pc'
to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable

Consuming pre-exposure material on Sam qualifies as its own genre of entertaining dark comedy. The broad themes are always the same -- hosts laud his genius, ask no real questions, and make dozens of grand assertions with absolute confidence.

Highlights of [Acquired's FTX episode](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/ftx-with-sam-bankman-fried-mario-gabriele):

* In the hosts' own words, FTX's 10x growth in valuation for 2021 was quote "unbelievable". Literally correct.

* Sam is not shy about congratulating his own brilliance, but the hosts do most of the work for him, unprompted. He's compared to Jeff Bezos 3-4 times, and not in succession. The comparison is resurrected again and again to drive it home.

* A hearty laugh is shared as Sam jokes "all you have to do to beat Mt. Gox is not lose everyone's money". So on the nose.

* He was thinking about leaving his suit at his brother's in DC because except for wearing it for congress, he didn't know when he'd use it again. Good thing he didn't, having since gotten good mileage out of it in [the Bahamas](https://twitter.com/tier10k/status/1602807152456138752) and NYC.

The greatest moment is when Sam is bestowed the appellation **"the zeitgeist artist of our time"**, meaning that he understands today's confluence of culture and technology better than anyone else on Earth.

Doesn't every programmer secretly love the idea of a mainframe? One giant machine that runs everything and has its own redundancy internally. Ensuring scalability through processes designed to be run in parallel is obviously more practical and more robust nowadays, but if you were to try and run Twitter on one machine, you might be able to get results that aren't _too_ much worse, and with 1000x less infrastructure.

It wasn't too long ago we were really trying to do this. At iStock circa 2011 where the ops team was running the asylum, right around the end of my tenure we purchased a huge mainframe-esque box that advertised being able to stay online even if one of its CPUs failed. I was never sworn in on how much it cost, but undoubtedly the price tag would've made my eyes bleed. That was right around the period where misguided attempts to scale vertically and racking your own specialized hardware was already starting to look pretty silly, so I'm curious in retrospect how far it made it into production.

I added some code to the build process convert them to WebP (96% support), but that in turn required sizable refactoring to support outputs with an extension different than their input.

I should investigate using WebP as a general target regardless of the input format since it overall seems like a better default that produces better results _by default_ compared to mucking around with JPGs and PNGs. But it's not super pressing because although WebPs will produce considerably better compression than most JPG exports, they're not too much better than a JPG that's been [optimized via MozJPEG](fragments/libjpeg-mozjpeg), which this site does.

A guilty pleasure is reading other peoples' multi-thousand word reviews on Leica cameras. From today: [Fujifilm to Leica](https://arslan.io/2023/01/06/from-fujifilm-to-leica-my-experience-with-the-m11/) which goes into detail in rationalizing buying an M11.

I hate that I love these cameras. At Heroku we had a few vocal Leica users. One went as far as to sell all his equipment to simplify his life on a single Leica rangefinder and lens (an M9). But like the Leica brand itself, the move wasn't about practicality or technical superiority, it was about romance. Leica doesn't sell cameras, it sells lifestyles, and fans do 80% of the work for them. See also [sh*t Leica photographers say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqaGFVJPJRg).

Years later I'd pick up a Q, an amazing camera. The best that Leica's ever produced. But once you've dipped your toes in, you're forever haunted by the siren call of the M-series.

M cameras are a rip off ($9k for an M11 body + $6k for a lens). _Everybody_ knows they're a rip off. No honest person even tries to argue they're not a rip off. But they're well-designed, and again, supremely romantic.

I check in every so often, and luckily, have held the line. Besides the price tag:

* Rangefinders were always questionable, but EVFs made them obsolete. This might be debatable, except we have proof that Leica knows it too. The camera doesn't come with an EVF, but Leica won't hesitate to sell you one. For $750.

* $15k. Not weather sealed.

* Questionable software. Slow start up time.

On the plus side, the M11 did away with the bottom plate, a feature that'd been left in until the M10 for historical reasons, but completely impractical in every way. You can't beat full frame in a body that size, or the minimalist controls.

Leica must send $100M/yr Fuji's way to keep cameras on APS-C and with at least six unnecessary dials each. It's the only explanation for such magnanimity in staying out of the competition.

Contrary to popular belief, it doesn't rain that much in San Francisco. A few dozen times a year it does. Very occasionally, it rains an unusual amount. Today it rained 0.83", which is kind of a lot, I guess.

Tokyo's rainiest month of October averages 9.24" over ~12 days of rain. In other words, the poor Japanese are dealing with twelve _**THE BOMB CYCLONES**_ just in the month of October, every year.

English language Stack Exchange [bans ChatGPT-generated answers](https://english.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/15500/announcement-ai-generated-answers-are-officially-banned-here), taking a step beyond what the network as a whole has committed to.

For years the concerns from public intellectuals (few of whom are AI or computer specialists) over <acronym title="General Artificial Intelligence">AGI</acronym> have felt overblown to me, but ChatGPT's got me officially worried. Not that AGI's going to take over the world and enslave us all, but rather that we're about to smash headlong into a creative wall in communication and writing as ChatGPT becomes the perfect remixer, able to endlessly recycle new permutations of the existing bulk of human output in a way that's convincing enough for us to accept. Never able to produce anything interesting or new, but with few people who notice since we spend our days consuming human-regurgitated remixes anyway.

I'm expecting more announcements like Stack Exchange's over the coming months. Discerning humans can _probably_ distinguish ChatGPT output for their chosen field, for now, but it's certain to make problems in everyday life. For example, search engine spammers taking their game to a new level with AI-produced filler far more convincing than the Markhov Chain or plagiarism techniques they use today. Firms using it for frontline support to lead customers in endless rhetorical circles even more frustrating than the precanned answers and telephone mazes of today. Phishing seniors via email with previously unimaginable sophistication.

You can't put this genie back in the bottle. If we don't make it, China will. Regulation's a tempting idea, but lawmakers, barely able to sound even partially articulate in hearings over comparatively simple issues like social media, are wholly unequipped to tackle such a complex subject.

[Bloomberg reports](https://archive.is/HanS3) how Shopify is canceling recurring meetings with more than two people to kick off 2023.

Tobi’s taking a lot of flak over it from middle managers on HN (my favorite from the high drama category: “Tobi has done this a couple times [...] it comes from a place of narcissism”). I think it’s a great idea. In the early 2010s at Heroku I’d started to think that at least as far as tech was concerned, meetings were a solved problem. It was an engineering-driven culture, and most engineers hated them, so we’d schedule as few as possible, with only a few key ones per week. But then I got to Stripe and realized that I’d been living in a bubble -- an uncomfortable truth of the universe is that most people _love_ meetings, even if they think they don't, and doubly so for well-pedigreed Stanford types most likely to work at top Silicon Valley firms. Far from being an element of change, tech was only the latest continuation of a long tradition in big American business. Every satirical pane from 90s Dilbert cartoons held perfectly true.

Based on testimony from Shopify employees, Bloomberg gets a few points wrong:

* Meeting cancellations aren’t permanent. The move wipes the slate clean, but important meetings can be put back on the docket.

* It’s not the first time Shopify’s done it. One person says that these events were originally aimed to occur every `rand(600) + 300` days.

Targeting recurring meetings specifically is the right move. These get slapped onto calendars, often for large groups, and their tendency is to stay after their inertia's built. Before long no one can even remember a time without them, and it’d be heresy to challenge their existence. Ending recurring meetings by default shifts the burden of proof to the right place -- it’s now on middle management to re-justify their existence rather than falling to a maverick engineer who has to burn social capital in a risky attempt to argue for their discontinuation.

Occasionally, especially when thinking about past around the holiday season, I'll use the Way Back Machine to take a look at sites which I used to consider the absolute pinnacle of great web design back in the day. [Today's specimen](https://web.archive.org/web/20090217010618/http://www.alistapart.com/) is _A List Apart_, a site that writes about web design. Screenshot of a 2009 capture below.

Some things that come to mind:

* We all loved small fonts back then. The body text here is ~8pt Verdana which is a style I used all over the place back in the 2000s. I'd hazard a guess that the reason a lot of us liked them is that larger fonts didn't look anywhere near as good as they do now, before the advent of subpixel anti-aliasing and retina displays.

* A key element that makes the web today look as good as it does are fonts, which render so beautifully nowadays that it makes the web's default look quite good, even where minimal design has been applied. Old sites _should_ benefit from these advancements, but it never seems to translate through. Their fonts don't look great and it makes the whole site not look great.

* The broad strokes of this old layout are excellent, and better than [alistapart.com](https://alistapart.com)'s current site. The specifics are a bit dated and it needs niceties like responsiveness, but a little modernization would easily bring it up to date. The current era of web design is too quick to remove any and every extraneous element, and although the baseline product is decent, 2022's internet looks uniform and somewhat bland.

* Notice all the text in images? (e.g. in the logo, "An event apart", "A book apart", etc.) The reason people did that is that it looked better than what the web browser could render at the time. Programs like Photoshop would yield additional anti-aliasing beyond the browser's discrete, blocky pixels. It's ironic that transported through time, text that was put in images to look better now looks much worse.

Wrote [a few notes on publishing iOS live photos](/fragments/ios-live-photos-and-ffmpeg), involving exporting a `.mov` from iOS and running it through ffmpeg to fix aspect ratio, scale, strip audio, and convert to web-friendly codecs. Taking live photos is a nice alternative to shooting in video mode because you can have them captured by default, so there's a lot less mucking around with start/stop.

A major takeaway: you can make a `<video>` behave like a classic animated GIF by having it `autoplay` and `loop`, but only by also including the `muted` option, which browsers require before allowing autoplay to prevent us all from losing our minds.

``` html
<video autoplay loop muted playsinline>

The Calgary Zoo yesterday, somewhere I haven't been in years. The grounds feel smaller now, but the animals are impressive, and we got lucky with many out in the open. Amongst others:

* Extraordinary penguin exhibit -- lots of them, very active, and multiple locations indoors and out. (I wish I'd gotten some photos, but was holding coffee at the time.)
* Cougars jumping, climbing, and very lively. (The polar opposite of the snow leopards.)
* A gorilla couple with a young baby that attached itself to the mother's arm as she roamed.
* Two Komodo dragons, with one hanging out right in the open a few feet from the glass.
* A pack of wolves circling energetically within inches of the observation perch.
* A troupe of Japanese macaques, which I haven't seen since visiting Japan. (Too bad there wasn't an onsen.)

We've switched away from traditional soft deletion using a `deleted_at` column which is wound into every query like `deleted_at IS NULL` to one that uses a schemaless `deleted_record` table that's still useful for debugging, but doesn't need to be threaded in throughout production code, and razes a whole class of bugs involving forgotten `deleted_at IS NULL` predicates or foreign key problems (see [_Soft deletion probably isn't worth it_](/soft-deletion)).

I recommend the use of a generic insertion function:

The big news is that Shopify's YJIT (Yet Another Ruby JIT) engine is out of experimental status and now considered production ready, having been battle-tested at Shopify for a year.  As [CEO Tobi notes](https://twitter.com/tobi/status/1605663610906152960):

> Very good chance that YJIT is now running more ruby net code than any other VM. Shopify storefronts are a sizeable percentage of all web traffic!

Benchmarks show a performance improvement of ~40% over CRuby, so it's exciting for all Ruby users, including us. I can't imagine not looking into switching to JYIT in the new year.

Alongside Sorbet, Stripe was also working on a JIT, but with YJIT mainline, I think it's safe to say that theirs stays Stripeware (if it's even still being developed). Shopify's demonstrated a healthier model for working with open-source projects -- by maintaining close connection with the core teams (including Rails as well), their work goes upstream, and comes under the umbrella of collective maintenance. Stripe's projects are in danger of ending up more like [Facebook's Hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack_(programming_language)), diverging far enough from the trunk to become a separate ecosystem.

Also nice to see is that YJIT is written in Rust, after a successful port [in April](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/f90549cd38518231a6a74432fe1168c943a7cc18). This in opposition to Stripe's commitment to a C++ toolchain, and likely to keep the project more maintainable and more sustainable (and hopefully extend these properties to Ruby itself as it makes inroads to core, which is heavy C).

The latest [Twitter files](https://twitter.com/davidzweig/status/1607378386338340867) by way of David Zweig, on the suppression of Covid information (and actually, read this [long form version](https://www.thefp.com/p/how-twitter-rigged-the-covid-debate) instead).

A few days ago [Elon Musk appeared on All-in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE5CTKqWEV0), and put it best: "all the conspiracy theories about Twitter turned out to be true". It was apparent to anyone paying attention that Twitter was censoring true statements inconvenient to the story being told by Fauci and the White House, despite vehement denial from all parties involved. As with previous iterations, the Twitter files aren't about knowing a murder had taken place, but rather about finding the smoking gun with fingerprints intact.

In San Francisco, properties assessed at a total of $59 billion have [requested resassessment in 2022](https://archive.vn/ma4Nk), having correctly recognized that owning downtown isn't as valuable of a proposition as it was in 2020. Adjustment would bring the total down to $26 billion, translating to $308 million in lost property tax revenue should all their reassessments succeed. Add that to the already identified $728 million hole in the budget over the next two years.

Claimed by the article: San Francisco is slow to return to work due to a high concentration of "tech and professional services".

Omitted from the article: after spending a decade spent increasing tax and slathering on red tape, San Francisco locks down earliest in the nation, and for the longest, keeping major restrictions in place until just a few months ago. Add decades worth of obstructionism having contributed to some of the priciest rents and real estate on the planet, in a major surprise young workers didn't find it a compelling place to hunker down for three years of life in stasis, and businesses didn't find it compelling to sit on three years worth of empty offices.

The good news: San Franciscans achieved their final victory in driving out The Bad People. The bad: rents are as high as ever, the budget is a smoking crater in the ground, and the 70s didn't come back.

The other day I found that my automated job to cross-post to a toy Spring '83 board started failing, with the reason being that my last [sequences](/sequences) entry was more than 22 days ago. Not good -- I'd intended to keep them more up-to-date than that -- but I don't always have anything new to post.

I've always like the idea of `.plan` files, tiny plaintext files that live in a user's home directory and which would be dumped using the `finger` command on a target user. Famously, John Carmack published them for [more than a decade](https://github.com/ESWAT/john-carmack-plan-archive). Here, in a similar spirit to `.plan`, introduce "atoms", tiny multimedia particles that are fast and easy to write. Along with sequence entries, they're cross-posted to Spring '83, and will also live at [`/atoms`](/atoms).

Xmas morning. A signature gift was a new Zojirushi rice cooker, so I'll graduating from cooking rice in my old steamer (even if you don't recognize the name, their elephant logo is conspicuous worldwide).

Zojirushi reminds me of the old Heroku office at 321 11th St, where we had a number of their vacuum boilers. They'd keep water at perfect coffee-brewing temperature, ready to make a Chemex pourover at any moment.
