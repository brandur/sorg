I'm trying to read James Joyce's masterpiece _Ulysses_, again, fast becoming an annual tradition in humiliation and failure. I've tackled my fair share of literature -- Dostoevsky, Dickens, Kafka, Vonnegut, Hemingway -- and for my money, Joyce and _Ulysses_ are on a level of their own, with allusions, puns, and classical references so rich they'll leave you reeling, and wordplay so clever that it's a wonder a human could write it.

But I've never in my life come across a book that's so thoroughly and so totally unreadable. The prose is heavier than a pallet of bricks. A few years ago I tried to cheat my way to success by getting it in audiobook form, only to be foiled by the narrator's dramatic Dubliner accent, which while appropriate, made things even worse. I gave up after less than an hour.

Back to written form, and 10% through. I'll make it, some day.

English language Stack Exchange [bans ChatGPT-generated answers](https://english.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/15500/announcement-ai-generated-answers-are-officially-banned-here), taking a step beyond what the network as a whole has committed to.

For years the concerns from public intellectuals (few of whom are AI or computer specialists) over <acronym title="General Artificial Intelligence">AGI</acronym> have felt overblown to me, but ChatGPT's got me officially worried. Not that AGI's going to take over the world and enslave us all, but rather that we're about to smash headlong into a creative wall in communication and writing as ChatGPT becomes the perfect remixer, able to endlessly recycle new permutations of the existing bulk of human output in a way that's convincing enough for us to accept. Never able to produce anything interesting or new, but with few people who notice since we spend our days consuming human-regurgitated remixes anyway.

I'm expecting more announcements like Stack Exchange's over the coming months. Discerning humans can _probably_ distinguish ChatGPT output for their chosen field, for now, but it's certain to make problems in everyday life. For example, search engine spammers taking their game to a new level with AI-produced filler far more convincing than the Markhov Chain or plagiarism techniques they use today. Firms using it for frontline support to lead customers in endless rhetorical circles even more frustrating than the precanned answers and telephone mazes of today. Phishing seniors via email with previously unimaginable sophistication.

You can't put this genie back in the bottle. If we don't make it, China will. Regulation's a tempting idea, but lawmakers, barely able to sound even partially articulate in hearings over comparatively simple issues like social media, are wholly unequipped to tackle such a complex subject. The only practical answer is supremely unsatisfying: wait, and see.

[Bloomberg reports](https://archive.is/HanS3) how Shopify is canceling recurring meetings with more than two people to kick off 2023.

Tobi’s taking a lot of flak over it from middle managers on HN (my favorite from the high drama category: “Tobi has done this a couple times [...] it comes from a place of narcissism”). I think it’s a great idea. In the early 2010s at Heroku I’d started to think that at least as far as tech was concerned, meetings were a solved problem. It was an engineering-driven culture, and most engineers hated them, so we’d schedule as few as possible, with only a few key ones per week. But then I got to Stripe and realized that I’d been living in a bubble -- an uncomfortable truth of the universe is that most people _love_ meetings, even if they think they don't, and doubly so for well-pedigreed Stanford types most likely to work at top Silicon Valley firms. Far from being an element of change, tech was only the latest continuation of a long tradition in big American business. Every satirical pane from 90s Dilbert cartoons held perfectly true.

Based on testimony from Shopify employees, Bloomberg gets a few points wrong:

* Meeting cancellations aren’t permanent. The move wipes the slate clean, but important meetings can be put back on the docket.

* It’s not the first time Shopify’s done it. One person says that these events were originally aimed to occur every `rand(600) + 300` days.

Targeting recurring meetings specifically is the right move. These get slapped onto calendars, often for large groups, and their tendency is to stay after their inertia's built. Before long no one can even remember a time without them, and it’d be heresy to challenge their existence. Ending recurring meetings by default shifts the burden of proof to the right place -- it’s now on middle management to re-justify their existence rather than falling to a maverick engineer who has to burn social capital in a risky attempt to argue for their discontinuation.

Occasionally, especially when thinking about past around the holiday season, I'll use the Way Back Machine to take a look at sites which I used to consider the absolute pinnacle of great web design back in the day. [Today's specimen](https://web.archive.org/web/20090217010618/http://www.alistapart.com/) is _A List Apart_, a site that writes about web design. Screenshot of a 2009 capture below.

Some things that come to mind:

* We all loved small fonts back then. The body text here is ~8pt Verdana which is a style I used all over the place back in the 2000s. I'd hazard a guess that the reason a lot of us liked them is that larger fonts didn't look anywhere near as good as they do now, before the advent of subpixel anti-aliasing and retina displays.

* A key element that makes the web today look as good as it does are fonts, which render so beautifully nowadays that it makes the web's default look quite good, even where minimal design has been applied. Old sites _should_ benefit from these advancements, but it never seems to translate through. Their fonts don't look great and it makes the whole site not look great.

* The broad strokes of this old layout are excellent, and better than [alistapart.com](https://alistapart.com)'s current site. The specifics are a bit dated and it needs niceties like responsiveness, but a little modernization would easily bring it up to date. The current era of web design is too quick to remove any and every extraneous element, and although the baseline product is decent, 2022's internet looks uniform and somewhat bland.

* Notice all the text in images? (e.g. in the logo, "An event apart", "A book apart", etc.) The reason people did that is that it looked better than what the web browser could render at the time. Programs like Photoshop would yield additional anti-aliasing beyond the browser's discrete, blocky pixels. It's ironic that transported through time, text that was put in images to look better now looks much worse.

Wrote [a few notes on publishing iOS live photos](/fragments/ios-live-photos-and-ffmpeg), involving exporting a `.mov` from iOS and running it through ffmpeg to fix aspect ratio, scale, strip audio, and convert to web-friendly codecs. Taking live photos is a nice alternative to shooting in video mode because you can have them captured by default, so there's a lot less mucking around with start/stop.

A major takeaway: you can make a `<video>` behave like a classic animated GIF by having it `autoplay` and `loop`, but only by also including the `muted` option, which browsers require before allowing autoplay to prevent us all from losing our minds.

``` html

The Calgary Zoo yesterday, somewhere I haven't been in years. The grounds feel smaller now, but the animals are impressive, and we got lucky with many out in the open. Amongst others:

* Extraordinary penguin exhibit -- lots of them, very active, and multiple locations indoors and out. (I wish I'd gotten some photos, but was holding coffee at the time.)
* Cougars jumping, climbing, and very lively. (The polar opposite of the snow leopards.)
* A gorilla couple with a young baby that attached itself to the mother's arm as she roamed.
* Two Komodo dragons, with one hanging out right in the open a few feet from the glass.
* A pack of wolves circling energetically within inches of the observation perch.
* A troupe of Japanese macaques, which I haven't seen since visiting Japan. (Too bad there wasn't an onsen.)
* An enormous [Malayan tapir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayan_tapir).

I normally wouldn't make a breaking change like that, but there was an improvement opportunity I couldn't resist, and the project is only a few days old, so I went for it. It'll be the last time something like that happens.

Each atom's slug is its published timestamp converted to bytes and base32-encoded (e.g. this atom's is `giqmrd2`). I changed the encoding character set from the normal `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz234567` to my own numbers-first variant of `234567abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`.

Published fragment: [_Easy, alternative soft deletion: `deleted_record_insert`_](/fragments/deleted-record-insert).

We've switched away from traditional soft deletion using a `deleted_at` column which is wound into every query like `deleted_at IS NULL` to one that uses a schemaless `deleted_record` table that's still useful for debugging, but doesn't need to be threaded in throughout production code, and razes a whole class of bugs involving forgotten `deleted_at IS NULL` predicates or foreign key problems (see [_Soft deletion probably isn't worth it_](/soft-deletion)).

I recommend the use of a generic insertion function:

``` sql
CREATE FUNCTION deleted_record_insert() RETURNS trigger
    LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
    BEGIN
        EXECUTE 'INSERT INTO deleted_record (data, object_id, table_name)

Which can then be used as an `AFTER DELETE` trigger on any table:

``` sql
CREATE TRIGGER deleted_record_insert AFTER DELETE ON invoice
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION deleted_record_insert();

As is traditional, Ruby 3.2 was [released on Christmas day](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2022/12/25/ruby-3-2-0-released/). The big news is that Shopify's YJIT (Yet Another Ruby JIT) engine is out of experimental status and now considered production ready, having been battle-tested at Shopify for a year.  As [CEO Tobi notes](https://twitter.com/tobi/status/1605663610906152960):

> Very good chance that YJIT is now running more ruby net code than any other VM. Shopify storefronts are a sizeable percentage of all web traffic!

Benchmarks show a performance improvement of ~40% over CRuby, so it's exciting for all Ruby users, including us. I can't imagine not looking into switching to JYIT in the new year.

Alongside Sorbet, Stripe was also working on a JIT, but with YJIT mainline, I think it's safe to say that theirs stays Stripeware (if it's even still being developed). Shopify's demonstrated a healthier model for working with open-source projects -- by maintaining close connection with the core teams (including Rails as well), their work goes upstream, and comes under the umbrella of collective maintenance. Stripe's projects are in danger of ending up more like [Facebook's Hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack_(programming_language)), diverging far enough from the trunk to become a separate ecosystem.

Also nice to see is that YJIT is written in Rust, after a successful port [in April](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/f90549cd38518231a6a74432fe1168c943a7cc18). This in opposition to Stripe's commitment to a C++ toolchain, and likely to keep the project more maintainable and more sustainable (and hopefully extend these properties to Ruby itself as it makes inroads to core, which is heavy C).
