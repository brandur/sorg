Any guitar teacher will tell you to practice with a metronome. _Always._ Any
guitar novice will tell you that worrying about timing while trying to figure
out finger placement, transitions, strumming, and every other concern is
impossibly difficult.

Keeping consistent time is something that I still struggle with. At first just
strumming on the beat at normal 4/4 time was a tall order. Nowadays I'm working
on accurately hitting my sixteenth notes even across more complex strumming
patterns like the one from _Ziggy Stardust_, but it's still very much a work in
progress that needs regular practice.

My guitar teacher gave me a pretty interesting tip the other week for
practicing with a metronome. I can reduce it to rougly this:

> Run your metronome on two beats per measure.

So for example, when practicing in 4/4 time, it's tempting to keep your
metronome at the same. This works fine, but if you miss the start of a measure
or make a mistake, you need to wait until the metronome loops back on itself
before you get your next chance to restart. So if you screw up on the first,
you need to wait for three more.

This doesn't make much difference for one or two measures, but given thousands
of hours of practice, it adds up.

By comparison, practicing in 2/2 is functionally identical, but if you miss a
note you can get right back into it on the next beat. It can also save you time
reconfiguring your metronome as you move between songs.
