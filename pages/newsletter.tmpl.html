                continued consolidation and confinement in closed platforms. Sent infrequently.

        <p><em>Nanoglyph</em> is an (aspirationally) weekly newsletter about software, with a focus on simplicity and sustainability. It usually consists of a few links with editorial.</p>
        <p>It's experimental and not widely distributed. The format is still very much malleable – consider subscribing and hitting <em>reply</em> to let me know what you think about it so that I'll know what to do.</p>

        <p>I wrote a newsletter called <em>Passages & Glass</em>, but it's been defunct for many years now, so I've removed the sign up form. You can read <a href="/passages">the archive here</a>.</p>

        <p>The details of most journeys are forgotten. It’s nothing intentional, but given enough time they stop coming up in conversation, we reflect on them more rarely, and they’re eventually swallowed by fickle memory. Physical (and digital) traces remain, but most of us are hopelessly bad at regularly sifting through a lifetime’s accumulation of souvenirs.</p>
        <p><em>Passages & Glass</em> aims to counteract this effect by pulling highlights into a permanent digital artifact. A collection of stories in an informal medium, with a healthy dose of software philosophy.</p>
        <p>So far it's been the world's least frequently sent newsletter, averaging about three to four times a year. Consider signing up to keep in touch.</p>

                <p><em>Passages</em> refers to the routes that we use to get from one point to another, like Hannibal’s passage through the Alps, Magellan’s famous strait, or in the case of my far more mundane life, a favorite walk from Friedrichshain to Kreuzberg. <em>Glass</em> is the material making up the face of prized possessions like my iPhone or Submariner, the window through which to watch the passing countryside by air or rail, or the intricate optics of my camera’s lens.</p>

            The idea here is to request something that will start spinning up
            the target Heroku apps so that the user doesn't have to wait so long
            if and when they do submit the form.
